# Generating E-Sports Commentary Using AI
created with Kiran Khambhla as part of our Art and Machine Learning final course project

# Concept 
Trained a GPT-3 curie model using Youtube transcripts of professional CS:GO matches to generate professional commentary. Used Tortoise-TTS to replicate commentator voices and speech patterns. 

# Result

# Disclaimers
Our trained model is inferior to the preset models OpenAI provides, but we wanted to train our own models to understand better how these models are created. Training data was cleaned, but Youtube transcripts often had misspellings or misunderstandings of gaming jargon.
