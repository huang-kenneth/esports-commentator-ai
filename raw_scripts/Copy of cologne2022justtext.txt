oh my god
we're off the first round of this grand final so much anticipation
and we get to watch that first frag of our grand finals go down starting on the
defense the defending champions navy phase poised to do what no one's done before
chad are you ready for this i'm expecting a nice slow start about things here
taking their time feeling it out getting used to the atmosphere but this is the place both teams they love they thrive
they're going to show us their absolute best kerrigan and the troops corralling up mid here
very passive stance from navi across the map waiting to receive don't want to get anything aggressive
until about to be deployed here that's a lot a lot of nades in the sky
still no one spotted first contact smoke's actually into the pit sty's blind as well he needs to reposition he's not
allowed to a quick flick from twist glock and he's not done one more to find on the side
and his twists again arrives in style for the faze clan planned the site
occupied bits already making a case for the retake it's mutual here
armor on perfecto 2v3 and caragoon dancing dies brokey next victim dancing
around the side time ticking it's only be he doesn't have the health for this he'd need two queen click shots it's not
to be you can see what it means to him wants to start strong first pistol probably
thought about that for many a night coming into this grand final yeah master showman right there carrigan with a nice one see the util towards the side here
you highlighted the smoke towards pitt it pushed simple wide they didn't consider him early but they didn't consider twist look at this three
just locking and loading taking the sight and broke he chimes in for the final two but now v they're not gonna relent here take you back to antwerp we
saw inferno there we saw the weakness we saw what carrick and wanted to exploit it was archside simples domain what's
changed this time round oh he's feeling confident eats the flashbang but takes a part shot
down mid it's a lot of five sevens clearly pistol of choice
for the black and yellow plenty of smokes here as well these five sevens behind the smokes they can mow them down 20 bullets of damage coming through the
top mid control already taken simple he wants to see what he can find flash not good but brokey he's gonna clean house
solid start into the side again sd white fate likely sealed garrigan's hunting him down is the five seven though close
oh no fumble a colossal fumble rain trying to reel it back in long range back 10. and trade oh
raps has kept them in it they tried to finish it right there and then and they know where sdy is this
round's done there's no way out of this they know he's in the pit twist can drop back with the bomb they can take to the other side and well faze recovering
there dicey for a moment i mean rops really did save the day there posted up on that library fight you could see
reigns fate nearly sealed think about the navi we saw yesterday in the early stages when they'd lose the site they'd say here you got to think about the
atmosphere they're going to get stuck in as much as they can take advantage of a little bit of extra noise back to the rafters as trace was mentioning
we'll just let this one simmer out for the next 40 seconds sdy gonna see what he can find mac 10 in his hand carrying it through and they're actually trying
to close the door in his escape rain's position is perfect if he pushes down mid dead if he tries to go over towards that arch side rops and twists are also
gonna remove sdy from the server here navi's newest name
see if he can hold on to this gonna give them something to operate with into the next round of play reigns starting to have a look and that's good from sdy
giving himself a way out of dodge here they really want it don't want any threats into the next
round of players that's perfect
clean sheet 2-0 they convert against those threatening second-round force you
mentioned clean this is what we're looking for a modern-day counter-strike the pistol round against the force fight and then you get yourself a bit of a
clean eco round here so this is the perfect start for faze surprise to hear the crowd favoring
phase little more so the navi thought they were going to be the favorites here
it's hard not to support this phase clan roster as you know the individuals have all
had their stories now all under one roof
oh that's a very early top mid smoke right you want to be deploying that normally after the first 20 25 or so
seconds then they have invested in four so there's also a bit of doubt there right if you're going to extinguish towards
sandbag it's normally there's a heavy banana presence right there so that's just trying to bait them into staying away from top banana you'd be expecting
at least three players if on an eco round you'd be playing top banana like that so playing mind games early here ah
navi not just mind games they're doing some gymnastics as well you can see that with limited resources they're trying
some hijinks and some gimmicks your crosshairs certainly not going to
be placed there around this corner well they're coming oh rain how aware is the norwegian today
hello and goodbye successful from this dastardly
just as things looked a little hectic again he saves them but that ak has
fallen into enemy hands the potency of na'vi's defense though non-existent he's actually throwing that
over for perfecto to scoop up he might just want to save that as if sdy can find a bit more damage with this deagle
or maybe another gun that'd be nice to take into round number four here so that's fantastic work to get simple activated early with a couple of clean
shots but rob's he's been on bailout judy in back-to-back rounds here really saving fazer's hide like it's not
there's no denying navi really have had two opportunities in two rounds to immediately post their first ct round and we're
already getting a bit of a violence against the chickens here two and then this nade look they're
getting the ak about to double swing rops just puts it right on the money and talking to money that's going to do
wonders for navi look what they've managed to bring through there's a couple of pistols initially but leaving with an 8k a galil and
likely a good intention for their first defensive round still kerrigan's called a good game here
bit getting called out by the bomb there right we know that the adjustment with the radius the bomb is going to play a factor here potentially as well if we're
playing out for saves and post-plant situations when we try and punish phase leaving the sights
i'm gonna get straight into the rifle rounds here and simple got his weapon equipped the same for brokey so we're not messing about here we're gonna be
getting into the big rounds immediately
remember what i touched on over there at the major they used arch early they were trying to target the position where
simple rotates to help out the b bomb side we're now bit holding b boom it's no more
very volatile on this banana holds was boom bit likely much more of a potent pair but not with twists there already
that's the two headshot heroes of either team going toe-to-toe early here that is great from twist he had the pistol and now
showing he could do it in the gun rounds he's been here before he's lifted the trophy here before wow now this is quite
the setup look at that that's uh effective three-man
defensive hold and asking questions early broke he loses the battle head to head and
kerrigan still there should be dead jumping hoping and down to the simple orb
two on its first presence in the server mort could be found i'm not sure if they saw sdy up on
the boost i don't know if he can test it or if he was even spotted but it has sent them back searching towards b smoke there what is perfecter going to do with
this does he want to gamble towards the a site or does he believe there's a little bit more behind it because the bomb on rain is making its way into the
site rox is just containing this and perfecto out of position means navy might have to save you did pick up some
util but would it perhaps lean towards a retake but as i say that with the bomb going down perfecto is
going to show some presents rain safe oh
they're coming they're having a look they're investigating it's time to set up that post plan
navi come and knock in timer ticking
this has to be perfect if you really want to go you go on the flash twist has vision counter nades strong slows him
cuts perfecto down in half and that's another one for twists alive now and a kick in nice frags out
of everything needs to get on it only needs to stop it i don't think there's time there's no time for this at
all a headshot as well for good measure
wow navi they put everything into that yeah really really they did simple look holds onto the awp here but the fact
you've seen them going for retakes like this early i mentioned a bit uncharacteristic yesterday they were more than happy to say doing it very by
the book and the fact that they get two here you can see pinned towards the top mid kerrigan just staying alive but when you see a heavy mid setup like this and
you know that simple is on the short side you know that the rotation is likely going to be far away from b electronic frustrated with that yeah and
then on start contrast faze just seemed laser focused well they don't want to start the same way they
did the major remember they had a pretty abysmal ct side and they had to come back they gave us a bit of false hope that that was a competitive final it
really wasn't it was running away with things taking that trophy away from the defending major champions so let me ask
you this chad what makes this different same teams big final big crowd why are we now saying we don't know
i think that this team right now they've definitely been able to deal with some of the issues internally that existed with burmis there right let's not beat
around the bush let's not be around yeah you were talking about big things well
sdy just seems to be the player keeping everybody cool keeping everybody calm just doing his job letting the stars of
this team function now the save dog means to buy back still opting for the two three spread on this and phase going through the paces
already getting brain up in towards that boiler room yeah two avenues of assault
procedurally clearing
territory gained no answers up banana for either squad yet
 lying in way this would be a great call here
say from the flash is electronic you may have to do a lot here sd wise already revealed himself into the side he said garrigan on the mid fight
and another back and forth they are into the site though simple what does he wait for the rotate
because that bomb is going down surely they save this son right i know it's a three-on-three situation here but again locked out
posturing for it still they've got kids they've got a bit of util for this smoke molly they can use
one of those over towards the pool i need to get past carrick in the flash forward carrigan steps out nobody's blind and kerrigan's down a big catch
jumps into their jaws this retakes on twists and rain now have to partner up crossfire established a great headshot
it's only one and traded let's face keep this up
canadian keeping his cool here massive rounds for him the pistol round the entry and the other gun round top banana
and now stopping this retake from coming through we really need to talk about the setups that navi are throwing their way and the
reason i said this is a great call is again carrigan's game plan looks perfect he's aware that the adjustment is not
going to allow the mid control you cannot get that arch side control if they lock down mid well guess what we're coming out apartments and sdy up on the
balcony that is a terrible position to have to defend against the pit it looks so uncomfortable for it now that's a very deep ct smoke you can see paranoia
spread immediately they're just happy to wait out this util and i say wait it out they copper ouch
big chunk of damage there twisting kerrigan low and coming through carrigan he's not afraid at all oh he's feeling
good about this quick smoke that's a lot of pressure now onto the cts
changes his mind a white screen and pushing through electronic good for the first on the pistol but resources limited
players as well advantage phase and advancing now into perfecto's domain a
quick one across the bow aries smoked coffins staring at the gray screen simple cannot
contribute oh spotted face starting to choke him out it's
simple though who does give us something to talk about another headshot and he does it 
on the triple gives navi life in the very first round of the grand final this is what you want to see you don't want
to quiet simple you want him loud in the cathedral showing up early
every round is being competitive here no matter what the buy is and they're still just imposing their
will onto phase through the coffins appropriately this
is delivering already we're only six rounds into the game here every round has been back and forth tight affairs going for retakes none of this saving
none of this putting the crowd to sleep they're here to entertain i think it's just a byproduct of these
two groups of players doing what they do best but look at what it's done right you have to look at the ramifications of
that this is showing you how close it was a 5-0 start and you're down to pistols you have not had an easy day of
the office so far phase sure the game plan's been working but the rounds have been close yeah this is where the scales start to
start to tip in favor of navi
they're set up perfect to handle what's likely been thrown their way it's gonna be strength in numbers from phase you can tell that
navi don't quite understand what the buy is here but they're coming their way could be a mop up here from beard up close and personal with the mp9 he's
gonna take two befekto's got one back but this is all beard one more with the usp
and he's gonna farm some cash there with the mp9 now the reason you could tell they didn't know what type of execute or
what type of rounds to expect they were super passive on eight but they have banana control but you've worried about a bit of an apartment's waterfall in a
situation like that a couple of flashes maybe some tech nines but it was just an eco so now establishing where the
finances are at now you will know they're up against dubai but take a look at the cheeky purchase from robsia
watch this one back again and this is great for bit he was an absolute monster yesterday on mirage i mean he saved them
he really did in the absence of simple it was bit this is a set piece it's looking very set piece heavy with the early util yeah
it's landing simple trying to disrupt you can spot it out flashed out and chase down look at garrigan seeing red and simple while seeing white
puts one down it's rain on the trade electronics spotted out rain advancing
his sdy force into defensive stance and a good catch phase now humbled a little
may want to continue this charge of suspicious smoke on the short side
how do you handle that and if you don't get through perfecto there was a second into electronic was
right there poised should he be required those last two have been the cleanest
rounds in the game so far right the eco understandably so but the gun round there you can see the pace change carrick and really trying to work that
crowd here you're going to see at some point he's going to try and get them on his side a little bit more bit of a trickster his old carrigan you
can use a bit of that sound here to help with faster rounds but this is good perfecto with a clean double and great stuff from sty on the side there just to
handle business yeah right sdy in this situation this guy gets plugged into an rv he's in the grand final right now
he's got seven kills to his name and he's hanging with the big boys
yeah definitely some parallels with sdy and bit and both of them have handled that in terms of being thrust to the
very forefront of this competitive practice
looking for that deagle headshot the only real hope in this one that's a pretty much a full decode yeah this is kerrigan just allowing his troops to use
their name right we talk about the spread on this team being very very even to get to this point but they're all stars in their own right the thing is
nobody's elevated to the level of simple and they don't have to they have not dropped a map so far yeah the run in
cologne completely spotless sure there's been a couple of close games some double digits but faze have not lost a map and
the desk was saying three players of the same rating this star trio this orion's belt of phase
carrigan has got still time to get up to no good
electronics on the way over here they're going to have the stack towards the right side aren't rv crosshair is bang on the money as well
it's perfecto sprays them down a bit close round as well flash should enable another peak and faze just falling by
the wayside it's rob's deeg arriving last will it be another spotless navy round
the answer is yes bit of a problem as well that bit's comfortable on an mp9 he's just holding on to it farming so
much cash here and starting to establish a huge ct economy timeout taken on the phase side just to
discuss how the game plan is going to start to simmer forward because it worked well early but navi being able to adjust through some heroics remember
this streak of four started with simple over towards b with a deagle and imagine where we would have been had
he not given them that life so necessary from simple it's crazy to me
you said he's confident enough to stick with the mp9 he has so much cash in the bank chad he's keeping it look if it was
booming we understand he likes to use it he's over aggressive he'd maybe get one and done exactly it exactly this is the newly
dubbed headshot machine oh okay he's gonna throw it away there you go all right maybe in that timeout that phase
called blade said listen mate you've had your treat yourself treat yourself you're stacked
we're stacked here in the lances back underway
what's the change going to be a phase going to take a bit of pace out of this slow things down try and milk the economy here
oh there's a bit of a glimmer unlocked advancing fast flames will lick him down
counter util strong and presence taken so na'vi now unknown but it's going to keep navi moving so this is just about
playing rotation there was so much thrown into that but they still have residual utility for the next minute and 30 seconds there's no dramas for them
they're just hoping to keep navi moving maybe over peak and you can see this back in simple is
it is an embodiment of navi's certainty you can see he's floating back and forth throwing nades into nothing that is
evidence of phase with a job well done in these opening 30 seconds
what they've been able to do here is push navi into the dark because of that rotation no banana info no top mid info
so they want to take this back they haven't really prodded just yet a flash forward with no nothing behind it at
least gives the indication set piece coming out here smokes over towards the long side pit again they did this on the pistol
counter you two look at that smoke one side flame the other do you really want to brave it
oh eats the flash that's space to be taking a simple break sdy sets him up but oh ahead of it rain
knocks the head off a simple and now it's sd wise turn just the one as they do start just choke them out
electronic has to be a hero here and still two of them finding it what an adjustment
snaps into carrick and it should have been won and done but electronic finally falls
and fades knocks the head off of the headshot machine that is nutty
clothesline cop that robs i said he's been bailout judy again
two big kills later he's electronic from the pit he's doing work too check out this adjustment one more time i don't know
how he catches brokey there but that one to carrigan is beautiful this this is quite the shot to be hitting on a grand final stage drop and
bob right there bang couldn't even couldn't even release his keyboard in time think about the
intensity think about the level of these games this isn't just get the kills and the rounds done constantly fighting constantly biffing neither team given an
inch here this is map number one yeah ten rounds deep
of a best of five the deaths discussed it
this first map is a key indicator the fact that phase haven't dropped a single map so far chad it's baffling to be
walking into a grand final without really remembering what it feels like to lose a map if anyone's gonna make him bleed it's navi
they've had their struggles here they've lost a couple but both teams destined on a collision course for this
final and we got it how often does that happen you get the collision
and collisions are set the course not yo yeah not yet actually gonna be
manifesting take a look at that it's presence it's posturing brokey dispatch to pick up the objective
yeah just continue to offer reactions here and you can see navi no longer playing that heavy mid setup now they've offered this like a little bit more
standard here but the b setup is quite retake within its nature the boost plane towards spawn
perfector trying to bait them into this limb smoke front sight it's going to mean a couple of questions but in this setup they have it's
actually quite nice for navi here a lot of information remains lurk smoke from rob's here and now that we're down to the final 30 seconds the
hit's coming yeah great time to drop the smoke sdy he'll have that up for the hit
something to play around chips away at brokey it's simple long range forces carrigan down into the dirt still
the setup is potent what can you do to break they haven't got the time they haven't got the time and they're running out of players navi mow them down upon
arrival it's only twists and robs and now just got to accept his fate goes down with the ship
blades happy with that one keeping the cash in the coffers four still alive as navi immediately shut
down that phase streak yeah fazer in a bit of rough spot with the money right if they can't get the bomb down in all these situations it's gonna be harder to
stimulate the economy here for the final few rounds of half number one so likely just to see the deagles again and that's
really working in navi's favor not having to be up against gum round after gun round it's gonna make things a little bit
easier for them because you think about this if they end up on six rounds here three of them will just be against pistols and that's fantastic work that's
half of their rounds so far and robin on the mark here having a bit of a chat with kerrigan second time out called
ending the season with the two major champions of the year
stockholm champions versus antwerp champs here in cologne
and there is not an empty seat in the house fazer cooking something up here
they've opted for a little bit of utility around the purchase right they know the lost burner's starting to build in their favor so some deagles with as i
say little it's just a light smattering a couple of smokes a flash of he so these need to land pitcher perfect
for them to get the most out of it and a change navi willing to start three top bananas simple and sdy to defend against
a we're back underway as they trundle quite quickly up second mid here the utils already being deployed
yeah navi happy to get that util deployed in the early game when aware
of funny business in dubai it is just going to be that last smoke deployed here it comes
phase but their resources towards the a side sdy panic stations looks for a safer
place to roost the key here is they haven't followed through with the execute but they've given themselves some room to work with here
well china needs to be extremely careful they plan through the fade he's gonna get one and he's even seen the second that's what you want from electronic
there taking care of business and now it's sdy and simples turn the combination on a clean
some incredible craftsmanship on that we even had jesus here like yesterday
yeah i mean we've got royalty in the building i don't know if you have to buy a ticket or if they let him in for free but uh it was great to see him
perfecto reactionary flash pull just in case bit requires the help it doesn't seem it'll be the case look at the
health on the canadian early doors unconfirmed but
bleeding out is twists
here's one of those new elements those wall bangs from short side and abs
i'm sure we might get to see it throughout this first map of our final simple lines it up
trying to chip further away and it does connect what an aid
certainly softens them up for this weapon in sd wise hands and good for it simple sdy again combined to win out the
opening exchange on a that's where the bomb is alex they've gone to hit the other side and left the bomb at spawn and the man coming back together is
twist now bit oh but wait this could be a bit of an issue here especially now that broke he's taken one twist with 40 seconds
left can grab the bomb and this is completely wide open but he has such low health if he was to brave it yeah
none the wiser but he's running into the stack oh and a roll reverse and it's bit that knocks the head off for brokey from
his advance and now it gets real spooky bits wise he's smart but will he ever
consider this a foot fault from faze may lead to a way
back in round 13 bit and okay what i'm sorry
he checks it and twists all of that for nor robs could do nothing too quiet for too long and now they know he's in pit
are they going to try and take this gun away after time robs needs to fight for his life here four seconds left on the clock and the electronic steps out not
afraid or nothing seven now for navi they take the lead and this is a difference in their ct
side this started one way and it's ending another i mean what a slew to start the
pistol the first gun bit look at this you can't see much knocks the goggles
straight off of his face i talked about the headshot uh
heroes of either team here bit with 72 percent and twist with 75 percent you've even got carrigan look not as many kills
here but he's got a 75 trying to keep up with the big boys yeah i looked at his event head shot 68 for bit
it's certainly an efficient way to get the job done well this is an efficient buy from face right they've leveled out the cache here
they've gone for a half by with the max loss into the last round of play so this here with a couple of tech nines it can
tell of something that they want to be a bit quicker a bit nimble maybe a b execute right i really haven't
seen them lean towards that side of the map all that too much but navi are one step ahead simple finally bringing out the awp again right it was the early
stages the orbs came out but since then brokey and simple haven't really been wielding the big greens i thought it was going to be b maybe
it's going to be crap over towards the long side here is util being lined up still a couple of
smokes a couple of flashes left over but the time again simple has rotated back perfectly
he's got the finger on the pulse they're coming his way trying their luck well placed incendiary
limits their options they'll be channeled close and all there's so many what a flare get on the usp
doesn't even need the big green to pluck the head off of twists
bit looking for answers one slipped the net and he's been found kerrigan down
navi a really cleaning house here though look i mean these aks are still in play these electronic bit
no better candidates and an eighth to win out their ct half
just a couple of clicks away they have to know this is possible navi right they've intentionally given up the space
here now bits position he doesn't have to worry about it just yet and the footsteps starting to come his way the
sound cue i think bit has finally realized in combination with perfecto looking to close this one down brokey
wants to find something here and he can't that's eight
there's only have one real spot on the record of this eight really good stuff four and then four
again from navy the final gun round to play the purchaser coming in and brokey getting
the weapon of choice back in his hands but we'll be light on the u2 here now look i'm comparing this to the major
final but if we're going to compare this uh with inferno at the moment actually during clone it's a t-sided map it's the only map in the pool that we have that
has been t sided so is six gonna be enough i'm sure they would love to get seven here well they've got everything they need to do it
and it's aggression from bit brokey prepared and he cuts down another tags up perfect so he is working on the scrap
of health one it doesn't get closer low as hell
perfecto wants to send twist there too well footsteps have been heard there from twister backing off that
relinquished top and under control swiss would still be brave to go around this corner without a flash
the difference here from navi is that more forward over towards a rob's job is to contain this make sure they can't get
too much information as carrick and the rest of the troops set up towards banana here for what should be hail mary b execute
so many nades on the belt of electronic he can react and delay
and they sail through the skies a smoke nade and a whole team coming his way perfecto
an electronic established can they defend the site nine looms there's not clearing the boost perfecto
and electronic oh he runs out of bullets he needed one more in the mag and now just a little bit of hope props and
twists these boys are spicy an electronic perfect timing on the push the flash it sets him up but only twists
and only one 
five rounds in the first five and then it's all navi a magnificent start to our grand finals
the first half of the best of five concludes and we're just gonna take two
nine major champions in the server tonight here in the iem cologne 20 22 grand finals
electric start from phase you can see the frustrations bubbling high in celebrations as well for phase it was twist leading the way in that department
and then the other superstar in the other jersey made his presence known yes since simple showed up had that massive
round on the b bomb side faze were struggling the game plan early it was tidy it was nice but right now
via poised to get to 10. looking into the pistol round here the buys coming through
it looks a lot different to face clans lot less smokes a lot more armor
navi now on the attack oh deagle this time around here from
simple just gonna be the p250 in hand and four man a lean from faze out the gates here a slight lean to navi in the
bookies they want to find him he's going to get
this fight perfecto spot it out it's long range that's what that extra pistol is for oh
glock to the dome drops on notice and run down a big opening
oh a fingertip spotted rejig in the defense phase one one back
and all twist goes looking and all he finds is death destruction brokey kerrigan on the side sd1 has
slipped through carrigan's aware he's got a lot of targets on his screen and he has reign in support
as always his trusty companion brokey not done a double more required
as rain rains it down we will see the seventh both pistols now that's both pistols for
faze clan 
calling out your friends
it's crazy how this one started felt like rob's had absolutely no idea they could be behind him just kept busy in that fight for long enough but
as i mentioned it was a four-man lean from faze they wanted them to run into this site twist gave away his life there which i think made them feel that the
site was going to be a little bit weaker and carrick and happy with that one so the pistol rounds great stuff from phase let's see if they can continue here well
they certainly should it's not a force fight it's just it one upgrade for simple with the deagle but remember that's where it all started to go wrong
for faze in that first half
this is where counter strikes got to every way you can find that information safely you can see that the tensions
were quite high there with the reactions we had from the players coming back in from the break and you can even see simple talking very intently down the
line there right they're just discussing what they're likely going to do in the next gun round to play because this one's a wash right if you can get a kill
sure but we all know what they're up to here right milking through this utility making sure that faze have to buy the
extra nades into the next round of play now if they get a kill or too late or a plan that's exceptional working around like
this but you can see here they're just hanging out really just taking a bit of pace a bit of source out of this one
when simple was asked about you know electronics integration as a leader and how you incorporate that with a
brain like blade his answer is whether those mid rounds are coming from electronic but there is a clear game plan handed to them
by that sixth man standing behind them yeah and i think that's why the conversation about booming no longer being in the team it hasn't felt like a
big one it's like okay well we haven't lost someone just giving away the opening deaths now and electronic gets to take care of business but that's
exactly what goes down on banana brokey and kerrigan quick succession knock him down navi made him wait
now we get back into the guns and we get to see the same situation
right we saw what the game plan was from phase early but it was quite clear the type of setups they were going for and
navi wanted to lock down top mid it didn't work for them great within the early stages they had to adjust
now where does navi want to take the fight here so they want to try and punish towards this top banana position it is against a bonus buy those smgs
carried across three but loads of nades deep mid smoke with the incendi from roxie to try and keep
them at bay yeah super interesting simple really prioritizing that t-side up he's not fully invested he wants that early in
the piece and this is a lot of early control
perfecto combined with simple are going to try and wrestle back for something
in the meantime up mid hot shots brokey was smoked and sdy has escaped
that's enough they've seen enough they're trying to make it as jarring for each other when they've taken this territory you saw the nades thrown at
rain now that it's throwing top mid they don't want them allowed to just set up and explode here but broke you will have to relinquish control of that outside
you can see how passive he's had to drop back here by that divider smoke towards long rain as well and this flash is set
up so we can repeat the half wall kerrigan's got something
in his back pocket here it's all about his timing of it rain is
right there waiting to strike flash
headshot they can't finish him running him down at a quick d another opening could be on twists and
robs here they're coming their way the bomb now slinking up top mid broke he doesn't know where to go five versus
four conversions are high but in 30 seconds still legs to this if
brokey the biggest gun in the server for phase left the gap now big gap a gaping chasm as these two cower it is
twists and rops though under-equipped for time on their side they just need to pitch up away the swing comes in no
trade available a big catch from robs more required rops gets two on the famous finally shut down with just two
seconds to spare the bomb will go down
they might give this one a look in here remember it was a bit of a bonus round there's a residual cash for most they've got kids
defecto is low can't believe perfecto after those initial dings
gets away with his life he won't he may not get away with his life as this bomb explodes
kerrigan sticking around and trying his luck there you have it and an ak as well that
works out nicely okay making the best of a bad situation there is carrigan gives a bit of a parting gift on the way out
the door now he won't walk away with it as clean as they'd like but two ak-47s one for electronic one for simple and they will
just stay alive those new changes i think players are still adjusting
you gotta remember where you planted the bomb the different range is also worried about whether the players could be trying to contain your exit
but this was great here it looks really specky from rain right on the jump it's a bit of a different way to play for that information but simple there just
lays him to rest in banana and robs does his best in that situation you can see twist having to worry about all the
angles as well the navi fans love around like that again they're back in with a curious looking buyer now they bid with a tech
nine interesting always the one sacrifice didn't hold him back in the previous that all being noted now navi will be on
notice for the rest of this round about the way that they have to peak these corners flash a jiggle a teammate
just swing into brokey here who needs to heat up 12 kills to his name he's definitely started to put it in the conversation but mainly twists in the
early stages of this map to put the damage down reign but up on his favorite little balcony here
we remember what he did in katowice
it's quite the pairing on their a defense phase
and they're coming knocking on the door robs and twists trying to poof cut down before they arrive
and they take out the super start simple humbled
bits turns into an ak so that's lovely for him but they need to go back and scoop up this bomb bay is still in this
2-3 spread twist to be the man to rotate over for the next north they're going to knock on here will be rain and broke his
over towards b that awp has been repositioned
final decisions to be made and here comes the nades broke he cannot
contribute already gaps are closing bit pre-aiming and all what rain down already what's brokey to do a good tag
they want to run him down and they will you can see bodies all over the site what not far off just through the corner
electronic plants it's safe and now phase this has got to be alarm bells a couple of very close but no cigar on
the spray rops is coming as a flash here that's
the only way back in they have to wait for this flash from robs there's kids for this
smoke banana that will deny sdy and now on the push this is so last minute this is so late
just pushing in they need to win every jewel navi established strong as they defend their ball rocky ain't getting
away with this awp they're not gonna let him but there's still one more hunting him
down cut down chase down and bomb concludes the 11th finale
that was even with the opening top mid remember twist took out simple so that was the number disadvantage fluctuation yeah this is traditionally where faze do
they're better work in the number disadvantaged situation here but that was so explosive rain was really caught off guard by that and so was brokey the
shot looked like it should have been on right there just a slight bit of damage but brokie showing us something special
before he loses his weapon of choice and now just down to the pistols fazer really back up against this
they're the ones who need to come back into their map choice
to lose your first map of the tournament in the first map of the grand final this
is gonna put him on notice right the thing is i don't think either of these teams know who is better right you're gonna believe that you're the better
team coming into this you're perhaps there you're better players you have to have that bravado you have to have that confidence if you want to play at this
level of counter-strike but if you sat them down and you truly asked them to be honest about which team is better you'd
have a really hard time separating the two you could point out weaknesses and strengths for both teams you could talk
through the run up into this point
i'll be used to okay twists again from the outside nice shot but that's the
only defense you'll need to get another simple tag down and bit he'll step on out happy to oblige
it's like oh we're repeating are we okay but this is the thing right navi when they've been in best of five finals they
traditionally do speed run it right we talk about marathon sprint they do it in the sprinting fashion a 3-0 whereas phase when you see them in the best of
five is a bit more labored they're used to going the distance and that's why i think the desk when they talk about who's gonna win this series
if it does go a little bit deeper than three maps you start to question the navi have enough in the reserve how are they gonna deal with this one
going to four or five well you talk about the sprint chad no better way to start that sprint out of the blocks by
taking your opponent's map pick exactly overpass next and the desk was also asking the question there how is this map coming so early into the best of
five ancient to be the third
okay options are gonna become few and far between for phase a stunning defensive haul out of not v
in that first half and now faze do have to match it they did take both pistols but didn't take long for na'vi to once again
look to be reigning supreme some sacrifices for faze again not a kit in sight for round 21. that b bomb site
can't be a weakness again right and you've mentioned about sacrifices for this one the fact that there's a famous for twists here and he's been one of the
most potent players so far could be some big issues but this is where faze need to really step up individually right if they come one's
not enough you can't go one and go down you need to get the two in a bye like this navi it's like they're pulling teeth
pulling you around the map and being able to convert rounds even when they lose that opening kill that's going to attest to the fact that one is not
enough it's very direct again right they're
keeping these two players planted on the b bomb site and the rest of them just start to comb boiler holes up mid a minute 28 left on the clock and they can
come very quickly oh sdy caught out brokey given a gift
can they continue to peel apart the four remaining
kerrigan dangerous game he's playing spots it out has twists in tow
flash might be required to take that fight because electronics hitting every shot he takes back to a four on four and
so much time still available where did his health just go shot on down still punishes one face
trading evenly rox has provided a nice one onto bit but it is simple
there's so much time to work this they left the bomb safe the bomb has not even been spotted to this point simple we'll have to go back and pick it up but he
knows that robs is the a defender and likely reign has been trying to cut him off with the pass to make sure that he cannot get back towards that b bomb site
so now scooping up the bomb 39 seconds left on the clock and this fight towards rops he is very low
positioning the name of the game
reigns gambling here he's gambled correctly simple cuts noise looking for his first
engagement opts for the molotov strafe quick from rain rewarded for the gamble
and just when things became compulsory phase do provide we talked about the fact that the players they needed to
make sure they were getting more than one in those trades they get the opening kill kerrigan goes down but then from twist getting the kill towards that arch
side rops grabbing one broken broken grabbing the other it wasn't necessarily multi kills right they were chipping in together in this
situation and then we're handling business but you can see once they get the space they're looking for both teams are just happy to stand and fight you
want to pick all right our aim's just as good as yours but this is great from phase here
need to do it again and well the buy for them still a little bit struggle some carrigan now taking a couple of chances barreling down mid hasn't been noted but
twist he's taking the push kerrigan behind the kills are coming their way navi on notice already just throwing
aggression an offensive defense
recovers a rifle a nice upgrade his life more important and valuable as he holds the access point to one half of the map
look how small the map looks right now they're boxed in here deep smoke back turned sdy cool brokey
little sloppy on the spray still converts and it's bits turn
equal amounts of time an extra man to deal with and contend with kerrigan and broke he admittedly
wounded but
this is all about the info here right not giving i'm not overpeaking a corner just play for the info allow him to take the space that he wants and regroup make
sure you have a buddy system going rops is making sure he can't go through halls broke he's making sure he can't get through
the jump he must have spotted in there broke he's starting to rotate but kerrigan's hanging around bit knows he needs to run him down and deny by the smoke straight through and great from
kerrigan perfect by the book play to get 10 now for phase bit of a ballsy one as well he
knows that bits charging towards him he's the only man on that b side kerrigan opts to take the fight i think that's important for kerrigan to do here
right we know that he needs to step up in certain situations hope it's tasty
counter-strike certainly is an early dinner or a late lunch or a really late brunch
we're all feasting our eyes on this one right now as harvey have been humbled here just down to a couple of pistols and the fact that
fazer battling into this now a bit of life in this just a two-round game and
showing more confidence taking more fights and reigns straight through flash stuff he's got no idea they're past
he's got him another one as well oh okay okay that is the most dominant defensive
round we've seen from faze it's quick it's clean oh he sees you he sees you and he hears
you the greatest showman in counter-strike yeah no one does it like carrigan no
doubt in the game out of the game kerrigan does it his way
and you can see this they just run past it both of them blind as bats hand over face and hand over fist phase
take a very quick one oh this last one's beautiful just swinging around the premonition from rain how many of his
actual kills did he see there i mean one maybe here on electronic and then the third just a real extra spicy meatball
beautiful there as the timer has been taken blade an opportunity to bring out the novel see where they're at what chapter are we
on i love the way they put on the desk talking of chapters i think it was matthew you know you're reading a murder mystery and we're just as we've stepped
into this grand final we're on that page before the killer is revealed we really do not know that uncertainty in unity
with everyone here we we all want to find out who will be the champion of cologne
and i think it's time we do another check who expects to see navi lift the trophy
oh it sounds similar to oj because what happens next is i say and who thinks faze clan
jesus and i'm not talking about the dude in the toga well uh look kerrigan asked
them to go full gas today i think was the translation let's see what they've got in them here
as we're back underway the timeouts have concluded
crazy to see the amount of gun rounds here without awps really in play and one for simple no one for brokey into round 24
and a very heavy peeling from phase in the early stages maybe expecting something a little bit faster to fight for this map control
passively holding onto a flash here to enable a car fight and as more youtube comes forward because they're going to stand up wide the molly's burning at his
toes and yeah he will have to dip back so not too much damage unless they use it as a shield
oh they really are off the leash phase think about it's a late banana take so not do they have control within the first you know 10
seconds they have control with the minute on the clock so this is perfect right this takes away a component of
navi's take hang on they're coming ray trying to help kerrigan out it's one
from him rain responsible for b and will turn tail
sweat electronic comes in within the mid round it's one for one he needs to move these pieces of the puzzle around the map a two-two split of the defenses
right now twists again he's been great from this position that's not gonna deny vision he has full information right now that smoke means
nothing to twist no doubt
no questions oh he's concerned about that second
letter of the alphabet perfecto dropping weapons faking out the sounds and oh boy
rv it's very light on time can rops really get away with this one
15 they still aren't sprinting now they've got the flash flash isn't bad needs one it's the bomb carrier
perfect from robs target selection and just with a second to spare that bomb will go down can't do anything about it
brokey and rain a head-to-head two-on-two
electronic on the jiggle reign across the line crosstalk
and it's rain to tie us up
he knows what he's doing
getting paid to play since 2008. he used to bring up a cowbell
to the events now he just uses the crowd that right there is perfect that is what
counter-strike is all about trading right off of each other the teamwork those details that is what we love to
see and back in with the brittle by anav this time the pace change quick up banana looking for the space electronic is going to take it he's going to get it
for free three is a bend of the word perfecto losing limbs
and so is bit two members of navi walking wonky
they've been explosive on this b-side before but this is the issue now the rotations come through phase are wise of their tricks
twisters fortifying this b-side not only fortifying flashing forward for a fight and they set simple up he's healthy he's
the star and he's dead quick one out a bit that's the trades we talk about but trying to get away his reign fills the void is twisting down
despite the low hp twist couldn't finish his meal and reign now calls upon brokie i'd have to drops again here alex this
top mid smoke is going to start to subside we're slinking down banana bit hasn't moved to muscle here so much time on the
clock to still make decisions for navi do they want to play for input electronics
he's waiting for them to go glance down mid this is the fight he's been waiting for a head shot angle fight
very hard oh elbow a tiny glimpse of information but it makes the
world of difference surely now they might be behind all of them here they're coming back no way no way
no turns around perfecto gone they're all there
shatters navi in one magazine them up knocks them down look at that
come on what a play man down mid push the ball's on brokey this is what you need to see
one and then the whole team melt at the hands of brokey
oh look at them just cowering in the corner happy with that one isn't he
oh boy back in the lead now one round game and another timeout for now v they get
installed they're getting stopped a streak for faze up to five on the trot
reminding us why it is their map choice and starting to look a little bit happy with
themself to be shower brokey in the praise as well or was that navi also getting a little hesitant on the commit i don't think
that they thought anyone would be brave enough to push down in a man disadvantaged situation that's a risk to take
and just the timing that he caught they were glancing top mid they were ready for the play the perfect timing from
brokey in that moment pushes now be down to just a couple of upgraded pistols and bit with an ak in his hands how many
times have navi been in this kind of scenario they get batted by the and robs through the smoke this time round that
was the ak they have armor it will be juggled but still it was bit that was so good digging navi out of the dirt
in their semi-final 
sdy and perfecto tend to be a little bit quieter here on the t side so you still have to turn towards the trio of
electronics simple and bit to try and crack open the rounds remember the orb hasn't really been a key component of na'vi on this t side not at all
yeah what was i talking about not a single investment necessary carrigan does track
well it's those two carrick reign constantly a nuisance a problem
oh how the tides have turned a 9-6 half from rv and being matched by phase phase up in the crowd and well
phase up in the game two rounds away from taking their map pick and force into the final timeout here navi right
blade's going to have a conversation this is fantastic the utility from rob's throat remember that double dunk nate over towards the arch of the early
stages to deal with the force from rv so rob's here is stepping up in a big way got himself up to 16 kills
leading the charge is broken with 23 feels like a pretty quiet 23 kills he's just one behind simple here and in the
head to head that's where they're matched up but blame blade with the final marching orders here
what's the answer going to be how do they get themselves back into this game a mac 10 out the bit here he doesn't even have a good spawn to use this quick
up banana they've been taking and sustaining so much damage within the early stages think about banana running through molly's mid copping nades
getting spammed just getting bowled over here in v and we're talking about faze losing their first map so far of cologne
guess what they've got different plans one of the few remaining opportunities
as it's quick at a perfecto great flash rain out in time it's rops that's
actually been caught out sdy catching his glance in apartments but look at carrick one tries his luck he's
going for three come on
one short two okay three navi running short of players and rounds again their
corpses lit a banana same position same place their demise in 15 it looms simple and sd white
what can they do about this they're just taking it in turns to farm
some frags in a grand final no less will they really remain
undefeated on their run to the trophy navi the best candidate
to push their limits simple's gonna have to push his if he wants to have anything to say about this
one again this duo veterans reign knocked simple down in
the last it's just a formality because we're up to 15.
the combo of kerrigan and reign they've been to every cologne and this time they're in the grand final
putting on a show no finals come on you know you've gone to so many
and as you are reaching you the peak the crescendo of your career the accolades they're showered upon you you've got a
very clear nemesis in navi
and they're arriving with them out pick and now they've got some opportunities folks three map points
for faze to stay supreme and undefeated here in cologne
trying their luck again into rain oh they're both down electronic slaps the veterans out of the server and
continues to take space this is huge from electronic but brokey trying to respond to this here look at the bomb it hasn't been scooped up sdy might have to
but rops if he pushes into boiler he might catch him here this is the bomb carrier he's not going to go down fdy and back to back sits robbed on his ass
rops could have done so much with that sty just closing out the head to head
and now yeah options very few and far between for faze to dig themselves out of this opportunity
we've seen what he's done he might even go for a play here he might offer something aggressive then they could be good cool simple chipped away at the
bomb is going to get planted here the smoke redeployed and twists has arrived to the party a flash and an incendiary
to get them in no reason not to go even damage here right just take away
these guns you do not have to win this round you just need to keep navi with weapons out of their hands
keep the compromises coming
bomb half gone two members low on navi bit was
healthy past tense broke he ensures it simple needs to get out of the site electronic close
and sold navi passed their first of the three tests two more rounds now but face you
like the play you understand the play damage was the name of the game you can see kerrigan likely gonna they go down to this beautiful double
from electronic here great round from him right they needed something from their in-game leader pushing through the smoke they're lining up it doesn't get
easier than that and that's an actual very important kill because sdy on the way back he was the man that well needed
to help the troops out as they were getting over towards that b site but they can buy the finances are there for both teams i wonder if those two
head-to-heads with sdy and rops are gonna perhaps take the luster out of his aggressions
will you really try it again when you're so close to victory good nade one shot headshot available now
onto simple definitely
just as he tries his luck flame smoke territory maintained
navier in no rush this is a bit of a different round here
faze loses sight and they do not trade efficiently likely to see a bit of a save here to go into round 30.
we need to start worrying about the finances here is the lost bonus bottom of the barrel or near enough zone
four players in banana sty just dealing with any aggressions keeping them busy over towards a forcing communication out
flashes are being used but on this b bomb site there's some key utility carrigan still with a smoke and an incendiary to his hands and as i say it
out comes one key piece they're going to extinguish and go here this is all in yeah here they come kerrigan needs one rain to support and to frag bit down
holds down mouse one carrigan as well they get the openings but here comes perfecto to sweep him under the right
reign stubborn caught now it's perfecto who's given them away in
still a man advantage but that bomb will go down a wallbang from twists achieves
nothing but that works straight through the smoke dropped onto sdy and perfecto demanded
to do it all or we are closing out inferno phase remain undefeated
the first of the grand final phase take them out pick and this is just the beginning chad
