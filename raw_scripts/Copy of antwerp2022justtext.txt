the players on the stage know what is going to go down today but isn't it going to be fun finding out chad we have
navi the reigning major champions defending their title against the undisputed number one contender in phase
world number one versus world number two the best will be decided after this best of three
i got a fun fact for you chad i was speaking to the audio guy he told me that the crowd were as loud as an
airplane taking off 108 decibels so let's do it one last time it's five
days against navi sport police let me hear you
all right pistols on inferno the very first round the very first
blood to be drawn of the grand finals
it begins here
slow and steady out the gates here 
filling each out silent any aggression to come in for me the team
the space taken 
place are gearing up now util in hands there's a lot riding on this pistol
and it's electronic down down and out bit having to go down as well out low
it's just him space and bomb plant acquired face don't have the advantage
simple looking to change things those bullets are fast they're furious and i'm sure navi will be too perfecto
though not out of it yet lots of utility time sensitive mission you must close the gap
close it fast flash through back turn and only perfecto head in hands face
find the first round
haven't quite seen an arena this fall for counter-strike in many many years
i've been meeting fans from around the world and what was the biggest takeaway for me was just how everyone is on the same page
they know the struggle and the stories of all 10 people that are on the stage today yeah this one right here doesn't
normally boil down like this number one number two the two teams that everybody wants to see the final that we feel we
deserve the final the counter-strike deserves how did you put it the world number one contender
taken on the reigning champ undisputed world number one contender yeah fazer number one in the world right now
oh man it looks like we're back the sport malaise
will sounds back into the game
some hefty buys by face here i think they know that the force is going to come out from rv immediately yeah really prioritizing and no smg's in sight for
the attack now v the specialist here in these second rounds let's see what they can
get across the line with a slight purchase a couple digs couple pages in the mix
here as well rally if you do up banana twist he's trying to take some space looking for a fight will be smoked off to deny so drawing out grenades
not too many more where they came from they will not be able to keep up the wall as the clock
plentiful my god
training of the control here phase across the map just looking for this space very standard stuff on inferno early nobody wanted to
be too pacey in a round like this i don't know what why they're up against
these slow rounds as well just help you get your head screwed on tight you had to walk out dopamine flowing through your veins you've got to keep a steady
hand process of elimination now for faze they start their advance
carrigan always likes to be the leader of the pack in every definition it's a hard crossfire to break here
stacks on the other side but they're coming in gruesome twosome electronics simple
called upon and the deagle strikes first good night
an exquisite double but that'll do nicely  garrigan bitter
sign of the times i think just trigger happy but that'll do
easy done right there didn't get enough out of the pit player simple does his job in the side all the attention drawn two's not enough to
stall this one now bomb goes down again and faze will be converting 2-0 out the 
gates those girls hold fast in that second round
especially on t-side inferno faze getting it out of the way first half of the first map of the
series yeah try not to make this one a third map decider if you're carrick and i think remove that from the major finals let's see if we've got it done
this time round that's what everybody's looking for
slow and steady wins the race here on the t side you don't want to overstep you don't want to give anything over 
much weaker this time around rv good trading on to the site here avi not worried not concerned about this
one and you could see twists online early with a couple of kills the smattering of pistols out again and
can there be a difference maker in the round flashes molly's reign on out installing any navi early peaks they've
got to hold them back for now
hasn't seen a single soul in these first two rounds
and that may continue navi doing everything they can to puff
up their chest fame presence and pressure
you have to take a risk in a round like this from navi right you're down to just the pistols here you're hoping you've gambled correctly
 the question is do they want to block them or do they want to let them in ideally have to run through the gray screen here if you are navy
still 60 seconds  perfecto responsible will get the smoke
out do they go through they don't have to decisions to be made and a spray does chip away
 just enough for a second wave here out of face
they're gonna test the issue ready and wait take down go simple
and that will be perfecto added to the list one remaining close and he's trying every trick he can
actually connect pokey surviving a blade straight to the chest
but walks away from it that will be the 3-0 conversion and convincingly so yeah
very clean stuff hasn't been a moment of worry so far coming out of phase
great stuff as well for the likes of brokey and twist to get on the board early these two individuals representing their countries the first from latvia
canada you've got rocks from estonia as well to represent their country in a major grand final
norway now well rain was there before back with uh that boston final i think that has
haunted them for many years oh that one 
it's been so much fun to see the fire lit within rain watching from home with your feet up as
your team your captain lift the trophy this year lit a fire inside of him and i'm sure we
can all understand and put ourselves in the shoes of him admirable stuff but it is time chad
are you ready for our first gunny a little bit of a bonus here out of phase they've got this mac 10 still in the hands of broke you know awp out for
him just yet but now we are into the full buys the face want to just continue slow and steady as you like or do they want to
try and throw something with a little bit more flavor their way defensive smoke drop top banana that's going to isolate any early information for now be
as rain up and to that boiler room quite quickly this is fast for the mid control only over
the top look how passive navi they're not leering mid they're not taking any fights they're giving the
room over chipped on down there i better flat damage but you can see the pressure
point that carrigan wants to work on here early
oh little little bit of damage inflicted unconfirmed but
they have a lot of room right right now they have all the room that they could hope for and some more just juggling here perfecto on the way back
over bringing a little bit more to the fight on b a couple of spares that will work out nicely with the time remaining just no
simplest position here if this is a committal he can get over and help this two man hold out very very quickly so
the response time on this will be fast gap in this as well
he's clan looking to put navi back into the dumps
sides takes down the leader heavy damage but they are across 20 seconds running out of players it's up
to these three and twist up deliver 
time oh so much damage one hp on simple but he does foul twists
a nice upgrade a valuable one a compulsory one drops alongside for the ride yet to die
long range frey from brokini one gets it and on the
that one hp twists handiwork may very well haunt simple and his attempt here
in the clutch time very low brokey six feet lower
simple one hp rob's yet to 
yet to get off the starting mark
have that three-man stack over towards b you saw the x2 come in simple speedway position he was there in time they get the opening kill looks like they were
trading quite efficiently onto the site but it's that star trio
broke he twists and robs getting the necessary kills on that side close it down and the aggression that they were able to continue within those fights
it won't allow na'vi to set up in that retake and look at this a bit of an investment here out of now be some interesting purchases
caesar simple with something a little bit out of the box here yeah and they are going to flirt with something a bit more avant-garde
off the beaten path it's a very powerful position from simple here not necessarily the first clear as you
round the corner the alligator might munch away at a couple of phase players here when they do try their luck at that mid control
pack mentality out of phase here you can see them grouping together clearing this out as a unit they have the utility to do so
six cents tingles but who will be made the ghost
is left that's a lot of damage look how low they are phases is a ringing
as boom it swings around swinging still yet to frag they're in a bit of trouble here remember this position
this could be massive right now but hp of phase is a huge problem here they're so weak
and simple ready to stand tall just the one kept honest
favors phase now heavily what is bit supposed to do a kevlar best and an eagle nothing absolutely nothing
and the same case for perfecto spotted out nice fine but that looks like a foreboding fifth
just try not to give over a gun here get as many alive as possible right now perfect they're looking to do a bit more damage
but this is a 5-0 start for phase this is beautiful stuff you couldn't ask for anything better on the t side of inferno right now
yet to see an awp in play for anyone money hasn't been there for navi just yet faze have had the options to go for
it but just want to keep it rifle heavy keep it as a bit of a pack is broken one that wouldn't shy away
t-side awp right this is the thing on the map like inferno if you want to lock down a bit of territory if you want to
try and stop simple from going for swings and peaks then yeah bring it out but if you're more than happy to operate with these aks it's a bit more versatile
so the t started awp if if simple has one and he loses it broke he might pick it up right when we see it come into
play here but just want to know the selfless nature of kerrigan there right him jumping forward you saw that draw simplest crosshair wide if he just
jiggle peeked like most players would though the art of the wide swing is dead right so uh carrie can just jump and
wide draw in that crosshair save them a few more bodies so big start from the leader as we get back underway
into round number six still no awp out in play for navi here but will they try and take some aggressions find an opening well speak
of the awk here it is from broken aggressive maneuver forward will be noted
he's fired off the shot and it echoes across inferno navi all too aware now
you can see this scouting party starting to poke and prod towards the apartments simple the same
throws a couple of mag into it rob's put on notice there
down to 26. so he's gonna have to operate a little bit more passive here up shouldn't be a problem for him but this is just the standard inferno at
the moment it's about pulling utility it's about playing the chess board taking it slow the default spreads
you know i heard from carrick's interview about t-side inferno feeling like one of their best
in the pool everyone on the same page i can imagine that's a euphoric feeling
it's game time folks 40 seconds phase flash simple out of the fray not ready
ray needs it gets it back a vital trade
and still pressure on v as well now if he's scratching their heads where is this final commitment coming from
oh down and out broke his corner through the smoke and now only one man can save navi put that
bound on the board and play time cancelled by brokey 
brain even had the rotate yeah that's the key right there that reign killed the trade back that was the most important kill of the entire round it
meant that phase didn't have to rotate back and try and go towards a they weren't just going to run in to be limp that kill actually opened the round up
completely here and all they had to do was find those kills and say all that kill from brokey through the smoke miraculous stuff right there just being
very diligent burma goes down and that's the rounds this is a fantastic start for face how
often you see navi getting blank like this a 6-0 star
i mean it would be something rather special if they can continue to build up on this
i mean six they'd have bit your hand off they would
and they've got it in the first six of play it's very unlikely that na'vi stays this quiet right if you're able to pass them
here and just have we're talking like a 9 10 round spread on this t side that would be monumental it's unlikely
to see them push that limit now as he saved a couple of guns the lost bonus is in their favor but that's where the
good news ends right you mention the awp it's not possible to get out still fazer be aware of that they have them
right where they want them they know the players that they're killing they're aware of the economy and they know the lost bonus so they can keep running rounds like this
couple more clean ones you can see the cash right now for robson rain both over that 10k mark and a timeout called now
the eye test here you need someone to dig through the stats but every time it feels like blade calls a timeout navi
respond with a round of their own the coach for navi is a mastermind the puppet master
pulling the strings and pulling his players right where they need to be let's see if we get that response
yeah they say life imitates our but master splinter and blade definitely have some parallels
because of this pace that faze has been throwing you might see a pace change out of them or continue if it ain't broke
don't change it navi would just love to find an opening
exchange here a chance where they can find a favorite jewel look how tight fazer playing they're not giving anything over at all
yeah boom just had very little to play with on his banana adventures
the canadian twists on the grand finals stage functioning with about half hell this is
the flash broke it on his signature weapon and looking to find
a way in they don't come easy little glimmer of
rain information conveyed on the regress
just hanging in the balance the simple puts itself straight into the line of fire
bit now called upon another on the t-side or broke he hits double digits
and the rest will come broke he triple what are they to do save again
this is very miserable right now and i'm looking at the details of this how many rounds have they pressured arch
they're actually trying to target simplest position on the map and they've done it consistently three of these rounds right now where navi have had
guns they're either dealing with the rotation right that weak point because arch is where you've rotated between the bomb sides or they're seeking him out
trying to bait him into fights right that is the perfect example right there yeah faze have come in with a game plan
of target simple how many teams pull that off how many teams are brave enough to pull that off
it's he hit problems as well boomers you have to find a kill he's not finding any traction in banana bit yet to get a kill
yeah electronic with just one simple has seven sure but it doesn't matter when he goes down he's not in the play he can't rotate around the movement i'll get
anything here rain decapitates one left effect though he's being spotted but he's gonna go on down clean sweep
brokey with the 4k on the awp that's going to be feeling absolutely a1
for the latvian and this is how it started chad yeah it
can't be stressed enough look who's the first step remember when brain went alongside they traded off of that you also had carrick before in the first gun
rounds rap archside yeah it's all been arched this is where the target is right now and now i'm here left scratching their
heads upgrading some pistols here down in the dumps maybe faze getting that 10 rounds on this t side is possible
i mean this is gonna be carrigan hyper focused zoned in
they found a weakness and you know we're just saying if blade takes a timeout they traditionally convert around still yet to see the awp come out i'm sure
that big red button will be hit for navi into the next bit might be the man having to drop that
you can see the residual cash he's left over simple obviously gets a couple more liberties to be taken and fazer just
sticking to the same script fade it out see what they're up to take the map control
they've got it down to a science now
quasi-bye for navi not interested in full investment for round eight
and again chad we've seen this before significant threatening damage dealt before the final commitment well look
where the gap is right now they can almost waltz on up just one smoke have nothing to worry about as they
their way up that short side but remember they have been going long so maybe they want to test that yet again
 navi seem to hope so as well
bomb on his back thinks better of that oh they looks good and that's a shot at
a bit sits right down a weapon tantalizingly close but another body down
defensive smoke just for survival now and retrieval may be more to be said about bit hiding in plain sight does
take another body times the problem here they have to plant they are into the site established but
with a man advantage for navi still seven rounds have passed without
any navi resistance is this where things change or can faze fight
three on four it's up to carrick and broke he does hit the shot and carrick good for the
headshot now running out of options that'll do nicely
it's twist with a two-piece 
and we see the score if you've just joined us yes this is reality map one of your grand
finals here the pgl major at 12 20 22 and phaser 8 and zero up
this is the reality we live in this could be the change right here we spoke about it the awp to come out for simple
half's already been one phase have done more than enough here anything else is the cherry on top but we need some resistance from rv now
who else was simple to try and change the dialogue 
another setup shift trying every trick in the book just to get off of that goose egg so trying to
take a fight here this is the first time they're actually trying to lock down mid they know the archers being that weakness flashes are set up this might be the smoke in the hand of brokey
flash from this position as well we've seen my pete try something tricky in the book back in the day
still with vision still no bloodshed it's electronic
he is a big game player the discussed it too out of electronic
i need more out of him though decisions to be made
and it's a big one out of rocks stops electronic from building further
distinct disadvantage only extended as bits does strike gets broken up against
the odds one luxury is the bomb but standing in his way
is the code himself using the smoke that's not gonna stop it
and there you have it navi break their silence and it starts with electronic
so you have to see a kill out of boomers here if you want the bad news report that's coming out for navi that is the changing of the time they do invest into
the awp they do find traction but it wasn't really with the all it was with the rifles locking this down top mid but
it was the stance that was different but they weren't giving so much space they were happy to defend and they're simple
finishing the round off here but fazer back into things a couple more of those necessary for now v if they want to break this economy right now full face
they've got plenty of cash to splash simple cautious
twists has a little ideas to aggression wants to try and
punish on a tiny slither of smoke but now already replaced
i've done a lot here right they've already been able to draw out smokes but she's going to signal the fact he has this famous over towards b
a clear intent now faze looking to show that that single
round was just a flash in the pan and regular schedule programming ready to return for round ten
look at where the one is though this is all just smoke and mirrors
there's no that's another one yeah this is all this is about just drawing the util out simple stuff from face here
spotted electronics selling the term of the head just to be very careful
we scooped up now time 45 seconds on the clock phase will show indications now where they do want to finish this round
what's the close are going to be flying relatively blind here no answers
top banana
ray just crawls on out he evades the first spray of bit and he is ready but so anarchy
simple one long one down only rocks really and he's got two simple
cuts them off of the pass and not the cross camera joint them brokey dead to right
10 seconds he wants to die and will a triple out of simple
they've been focusing on him still finds himself at the very tippy top it's quite clear they're still trying to play with
that rotation they throw a a b fake right you could see phase what they're trying to do they're just trying to keep navi moving
the v fake right there is to draw simple or whoever the arch rotator is over towards b nobody moves right navi have
adjusted they've said let's sit back let's wait let's let the fight come to us we won't create these gaps
simple shuts them down so great stuff here as we are getting into the thicker things now this is the opportunity to break the bank balance a big round for
na'vi coming ahead they can deny this plan if they can make sure there's no saves they've set themselves up to for this half back to be respectable
cut him out just caught him now just walks on up robs how does he find a gap like that they've been watching it every
other time and now it's boobage turn he needs a kill and he will find it
twists first time we've seen him punish for his adventures early up the banana you can see there is a hidden smoke to be
retrieved so how much that's going to do faze might get a move on right now they've got the kill they're looking for more there is a lot of pace behind them here
look at the gap there's such a massive hole right now needs to be filled by simple he's gonna have to do this alone yeah he's been called upon here nice
contribution out of electronic buffet still stubborn on the way in his shot goes punished and it's up to perfecto
carrigan refuses to die  a two on two
a battle of wits and fortitude blind
time starts to tick favor of phase robs responsible two orbs chad what are they up to they
can't miss these shots and he has rob doesn't just the one and only dude
rox and carrigan five kills between the two
of them nine t rounds here on inferno 
kind of wonder that opening kill from robs it didn't even feel real that it was happening because he was just walking out boiler alone you can see
some risks being taken now that opening kill is what threw this round into a bit of a tower spin it created the gap on a
then the fight went down towards b that's a massive response right there from face i still can't believe that rob's just walked out mid and took that
fight that is wild but simple to try and level the field here looking for an opener immediately he's gonna be
sent packing by a flash in space liberty's now phased they're trying to take a lot more room they know they can turn the heat up on navi now
yeah they found their mojo harvey's still chasing it
and there's been a dynamic feel to this phase clan it means that navi can never be caught sleeping on any
of these joke points you just have to love what they're throwing their way you just never know what you're gonna get next yeah the spanner in the works
with these dry walkouts we saw rain tried earlier rob's got away with it and with these walkouts he's just going to keep navi in a position where they can't
gamble they can't hedge they have to lock down these positions they have to keep eyes on
you that must force electronic out he's blind burning simple the same look at the damage and he's gone
hungry for the repeat and it is a deadly sin greed gets simple
bit got a lot to do with a very less than ideal buy still brings carrick
and low but brookie so far forward a bit stubborn on the defense
what is that from character tracers reveal him
they're so close to one another this is all hanging by a thread and it's the
electronic sets navi up for collection
can they really find a way in is there anything to be said for face clap 10 seconds is all they have to work with
and there's a set up one and done brokey can't get to the bottom
and navi make it three well handled now but the best they can
get is six here look and i said the best thing get a six we know that na'vi can have a vicious t-side too but we're just seeing them work into
things bit of an odd one there from simple right caught off by that molly you can see this here he doubted the spread he
doubted the spread runs across peaks back licks him in the final moments there and gives the opening to rain but not enough for face
to get on the board and look what has happened now to face these close rounds to nature in which
they have unfolded left them in a bit of a financial situation right now they're gonna have to sit back hold on to their
pennies the opportunity now for navi to build
back pressure is felt by everyone chad
it's just a matter of how they react to it conversation now for faze is about not
losing the momentum going into the second half you want to try and keep this tip for tat you don't just want to lose the last three four rounds consecutively
here you want to make sure that you're competitive you're keeping the fight up they're close yeah i mean best case we get to see a bomb plan and a couple of
kills but i don't know who to look and call upon for that yeah and it's just the same from phase here this is what we
saw from heroic versus navy just the other day stalled out very slow inferno that's a little naughty but
it's more hopeful than anything and that might take hope away
just making sure any of our newer viewers know what inferno looks like the nooks and crannies they're taking
our time exploring the entire map not only that but they're trying to fade out some of the ct util forcement to a rebuy
in the next and that's why it's this very pokey little play with the pistols show their face drop back
and then eventually run into the meat grinder simple's gonna get the first here perfecto and pumice over towards
 he's going to be happy without a couple of eco kills to get him up to three in
total needs to get his confidence going boomish has been fantastic for this team once they've made it to the playoffs here he's been extremely mobile as an
in-game leader across the map impact frags so want to get him online
could be looking at something a little bit more pacey here alex just taking no taking stock of the purchases that phase are starting to uh equip here
timeout taken for navi the second opportunity i think blade knows that if they can get to that six mark they're still in this map it is not done just
yet started bleak started absolutely miserable for navi that pressure point of arch time and time again hemorrhaging
rounds but right now they're back in it yeah blade somewhat of a savant for counter-strike and now probably just
making sure with his abacus that everyone is on the same page as to what can be coming their way
let's be curious if they're gonna be expecting a buy like this so he's trying to get yeah they're
trying to get the most out of this before it gets too out of control here it's curious if they want to use pace behind this they didn't buy any hatches
normally if you had a couple of nades you'd love them forward soften up on the faster pace it's not so easy to do when you don't have any nades in place you're
gonna have to hope for a couple of good flashes here but a set piece definitely on the line check that radar out four players for face quickly making their
way up second mid this is one of the pocket strats you need if you want to win a major grand final four members of phase clan stampede
simple has to recede double flame smoke for more pressure but call
that off that's huge that is massive from now be right there it doesn't seem like a lot but that is all the
investment of utility gone for phase immediately looking at yeah they were hoping to get away with a lot of space that actually means
a lot now we have just stalled them out completely here they have to come up with something on the fly wow there was five smokes
bloom in the opening ten seconds and there's more replacing that these flashes here that broke here
lining up is perfect try and get a bit of a waterfall strap coming out but they will need to get past three bit and
electronic are hard to break and simples there as well three players three flashbangs
these are going to have to be absolutely perfect here if navi aren't blind there's no way in the face they're just gonna get shut out of this yeah but rain
is gonna be the one to come in last looking to clean up the mess and here comes the command lots of flashes
rain has opened the account for phase simple one back hard shot
shut down simple long range  faze
with a cobble together by mac tends a single rifle pistols
break into the a site and booming just have to sit back
i can't speak to how ridiculous that is navi negated the initial onslaught but they had a strike that they wanted to run from spawn you don't see that too
often we've been seeing default spreads throughout that right there was a strat straight from spawn you can see the
nature behind it the smoke's already in the air molotovs multiple molotovs from navi come out top mid and you think that's
done that's that's that's completely over right here but broken we saw him in that position before and you saw how good those flashes are they're meant to
waterfall over as your players are jumping out apartments if that pit player wants to fight he's going to get white and that's exactly what half a
bomb goes up again and face what a half this has been so for the first rounds we witnessed simple being
the target those flashes have electronics name written all over them yeah that was beautiful stuff right there the fact that they were able to
pull something out of their back pocket after the initial strategy didn't work i'm loving this you can see the flashes here perfectly highlighted
continue to come on over a couple of them you can see in the feed broken getting flash assist there and that's exactly
what you want from a strat like that that is the pressure now turned up on rv safeguards shaw a couple of lime pies
around this here i said nine six to be alright 11 4 sounds absolutely miserable here for navi yeah it's looking
ludicrous though this is what he does best 
bit and boom bang and the final round of this first half
they do get the opportunity to at least remedy this defense hall
five does seem like it is a must
carrick are just forced to sit back and watch as his three remaining compatriots look to
bring something out of this round
navi seemed to have a good idea as to where they're coming from
it was rain before can he possibly find a way in again
heard now a couple of missed shots it's still
simple only one out of rain and navi hold on to the raids it's broken tacked up and body bag does
well five to ten all right recovery here at the last seven rounds of play navi
were able to pick up five so when you look at it that way a bit of momentum in their favor but it's had to be extremely
hard rounds that they're converting here not being easy whatsoever great half out of broken 16 kills to his
name leading the charge even though that outside was targeted time and time again simple of course 14 to his name
and finally a bit more proactive play out of navi there right boom it's actually barreling down banana before
that was very passive they were just waiting for phase hoping that they would come with a quickness
this would be some comeback for navi here we know that now that uh inferno can be a bit of a weakness some of the
teams do like to target from time to time yeah and phase have demonstrated that they're coming in possessed 8-0 for
a start a 10-5 half certainly can't be classified as a recovery
this is a big one equipping superstar with the advanced pistol for
these long-range jewels the usp favored in most of those with the gap closing quick
anticipation grows the sport police know just as well as we do this pistol has a lot riding on it for
navi map one of our grand finals some intentional steps right there just giving away a sound qr2 letting them
know flash on over information for rain and what a sharp boom he's down and more from
anyone else want to challenge out rain robs he's got a back turn hard to hit an
electronic slaps him down pressure mounting as they look to bounce and bound into the a site they still cut
off the bomb here carrick might have the right maneuver about this not bad at all and simple doesn't even click as he's
silenced by reign back and forth we go they're tossling for control wrestling in a three on three
40 seconds t-side in the open courtesy of reign
his heart beating as he's taken three out of the equation and he's not done yet
oh what a shot out of it but reigns still presides over that bomb
trying every trick to recover it has to be rained looking forward
to him and he continues to prove us wrong steps up
when carrigan and bayes in the first round of play in the second
half look at this all five for harvard night guard 
it had to be him no one else was hitting the shots
that's absurd right there the fact it comes down to a one on two and reigns already done all the hard work just to
get them to that point massive stuff if nobody thought they had any hope in that pistol rain has just ruined their
day simple he's looking to put on a clinic
looking to break the rules he's trying to take this on himself right with a purchase like this he has to find something he can't go down without a
fight my investment sure
really feeling the pressure here navi this type of a bite feels off scripted bring all their eggs into this
basket he's going to have a limp for purchase going forward in the rounds smoked off denied perfect stuff you
don't want to task with that one another smoke top mid continuing to block and it might be wanting to walk through that grey screen
harvey looking a little stuck here electronic respect the utility
carrigan maintains the futility of this round they will fall one by one
jumped on and that's a lot of cash injected into the base clan bank account 600 bucks per frag on the sfg
the unarmored navy no match navier out of sorts right now that purchase from simple there the question
is will he get donated an ak it's most likely that someone will drop in an ak and he'll give on over oh okay maybe not
gonna see something a little different coming out here buffets are handling this the game plan so far has been perfect
even in situations like that knowing to take the space late not early denying those pistols the chance to take the room for free but right here deep mid
smokes needs to come on through no real damage to find here just to be chipped away electronic looking for some space battling up behind the util taking a lot
of liberties and a lot of room here yeah that's a lot of space quick you can see brokey is going to be the
third bannerman to arrive upon the site re-take smoke to reign in the flames will force you
back or forward make a choice incendiary to spread immediate smoke in
response they will stand in this
constantly contested piece of territory and it seems face clan
i feel they've done enough
they have rain ready to preside
the opportunity oh lots of damage kerrigan though he's got his mp9 and it may be all he needs
dodges dips back it's boom unnecessary frag
rotates are going to be hard here and already cuts one down
rob's maintains presence on banana brokey encroaching now opportunity still
ripe for a phase 13. i don't see a kit
they're running out of time they are running out of time and especially now perfecto
robs his ambitions change now he's not looking for the round he wants an rv to go down with the ship
he knows things are tight chad smart play from rob said there's no way out if they're gonna try and run out they're gonna have to run past him here
he can get both of these kills with these but the round is not these robs gets the reaction from the crowd
but now they get the six notched onto the scoreboard there's still a six-round difference and you're exactly right
knowing the financial damage that's gonna come through with the round like that still an opportunity here
for face to finish this quickly right now we are not in a good place the fact that they were able to trade out onto that site quite efficiently they thought
that carrigan did a lot there it was the kill from bit down banana that was key stalled it out the low hp perfecto with
a couple of big frags to his name both teams still have to get to a buy
because it was a bonus front phase they had a lot of smgs now they're into a lot more rifles here let's see if the script
is gonna be flipped this battle of futility so many nades
leaving hands and it's aggression oh what a shot rain catches electronic just as he leaps
over the half wall a quick reaction
the navi chants begin again as fans start to believe not gonna be easy
in somewhat of a hole on rb 
see how worried they are here they didn't have full map control so the fact that simple as being that diligent
unawares of what phase are currently set up with a two-two spread utils light here for
navi just gets away from it relatively unscathed lack of information for fazer
they are in the dark no information taught me no information banana at all oh this is gonna be a
real tight one for these two four on four it's easy to find that
number advantage in your commitment as that decide brookie's been great 18 kills he needs a couple more here if
they want to test his side of the map 80 top of the server
i know he have to get into this bomb side what a shot at a bit that's galil hold on robs
yeah he's got activate he's tucking in that's a free one needs more they are entering the site a
well pressed nade doesn't quite catch perfecto and another successful take of the site
three on three wounded a phase are you supposed to crack back into the
site crossfires have been established bitter peak off of contact but it may
not be necessary simple finds carrigan on the crawl through
and some of the sharpest tools now on the way back in it's gonna be hectic he knows graveyard but running out of time
there's one and it's perfecto secures the round for navi really well
done there that was the kill on to brokey right opens up the site gives them an opportunity to wrap on in and look a little bit worrisome there in the
final stages but faze now they have to ask themselves a couple of questions pinching pennies this time but it's
gonna be on the other side of the server on this defense we still have to take an eco late within that first half they can have to do it early within this second
clawing back into this now an rv and they're doing it with a different pace it's not this slow default spread they're actually charging up bananas so
when we talk about the game plan of phase in the first half it was outside clean navi think banana is somewhere they can pressure early
robs can do here he wants to be a crowd favorite does robs saw plenty of that in the show
match drops yeah we did no revolvers here though
certainly a few counter-strike cowboys ray oh that's juicy
he's caught electronic they're saving their pennies and
really should have no voice in this round whatsoever but what is that simple one garrigans
hit another on the usb and it has to be perfecto to pick up the pieces
they've got plenty of time it still has to be a navi round oh more damage
palms a little sweaty now as they do want to get that bomb down another big one out of perfecto at this point
and it loses its potency albeit foreboding threatening from phase
perfecto has put them down it doesn't matter how navi are getting these rounds on the ball but you're right perfecto that's the name we have
to keep on saying here in a lot of these situations where it's getting tight his rounds have been key but the kills that he's been able to pick up
he's been bailing them out of dodge
perfectly tied by the crowd on that one bomb goes off round on the board for the different tiers navi suddenly mount a
bit of a comeback starting to make this one interesting oh more than interesting chad i think this is where face they thought they were about to just put it
in well we all know the woes that faze have had on this map once upon a time i'm gonna go back four long years
the boston major i'd argue i don't think it feels like uh long years for carrick just seeing him
compose himself on the stage rain was alongside for that as well
to be so so close to that trophy you have to get a gun rounds here on the ct side
they support back in bit ladder on youtube rain chipped away at early harvey definitely want to take the
fights much earlier than faze did and people feel quite right to be saying exactly that three rounds in consecutive
fashion out of a rv
can they build further into it it's phase that look to adjust they're lacking utility here right so
they are going to have to take a couple of these glances with their bodies put their bodies on the line not just be able to defend with utility alone
i think they softened up this b site early it is very susceptible right now to a fully executed the way that they're postured here tells me
i was about to say that it might have to be a bit of a save if they walk into this b site and now that they've gotten out freebie maybe it'll have to be exactly that oh no
a horrible death to stomach for carrigan just a reaction speed test out of
boomage and there's more to come way more to come
defensive smoke there towards that short side trying to round them here over into twist domain
potent pairing good made a twist actually charging in he wants four and he'll take a bow
my god simple does manage to keep control only for a moment and back and forth trading blows both wounded and low
and 20 seconds now we need to get into that site rain knows it as does brokey it's the
bomb on the back of perfecto can he get into the side the answer is given no
brokey bit time oh my god it's a journal plan makes an executive decision just in time
he will get it down the yard can't
to the doldrums of economic despair 
show us this one again look at the time on the clock because walks out he gets that open and that's the bomb drop nine
seconds gets the kill picks it up at eight seconds starts planting broke he's pivoted too far back the bomb goes down
and problems for phase now 19 years of age how many 19 year olds
are in this stadium today and one of them does that
for navi real problems for phase now this comeback is on oh yes like donkey kong
bye bye garrigan and reign
sent back to spawn a well placed nade chips away
unconfirmed electronic and simple slightly tickled but
there's no laughing mata for faze clan trying to discuss what the game plan for faze could be going forward here we had
the same conversation with navi in the first half they were getting blanked remember that oh ao start it was fantastic from face the t side was
looking well oiled well drilled now the same thing for navi hasn't been this clean a couple of closer rounds they've needed the individuals to battle them
out but remember it was the awp when it came out for simple is when navi eventually started getting rounds on the
border now it wasn't necessarily through his kills early but it was through the way that they approached the rounds they're a bit more forward they're ready
to fight and now the brokey has kept himself a bit more residual cash here we should
see the same adjustment being made from face you know there's so many candidates that
we discussed for navi it looked like simple i mean amazing that he managed to go from 13th or something rated in the
tournament to number one now rivaling that a bit who's been in incredible form
same form by which he dominated in stockholm
a two-round deficit now chad phases funds
just where they need to be this is the first time out here at face right this is the first time they're gonna have a conversation that just talked about it
they don't have a coach behind them right they've got the manager there unfortunately robin can't be here with the team but
kerrigan he's got a massive brain on those shoulders he's gonna be able to come up with some solution to this and
as forecast it looks like broken gonna be bringing out the big green
close to an idyllic buy for both squads
our 23rd round of play now just a two-round gap
electronic looks like he's got some intent and supported by the framework of utility he's already up and carrick and
last time he tried his luck boom knocked him down
same state of play
 the first test at an rv here but look at how navi are rerouting right now this is
very telling that they want to try something on the other side of the map here they've been able to pressure phase force out that utility a lot earlier
they're in the dark this is fantastic for navy that b pressure throughout this half has been phenomenal and now they can chop and change and now change the
tide of the rounds here
another smoke deployed over towards a that's gonna be the final smoke here nothing left for faze to defend with the grey screen they're gonna have to get it
done with bullets they're not short on individual prowess chad our face clan
this is on rob and they are charging into rock one and done low on electronic that should
be finished by twist and he's done it brokey alongside for the ride running out of players navi can't get through
it's only perfecto fakes the shot beautiful move and a great headshot but down in the
flames falls to his own started to conjure a little something
magic there but fool's foul to his own flame first summit would be proud yeah
wasn't on that major grand final stage though fantastic stuff for broke he brings out the orb they deal with it and you can
see the change there a time out back from navy here coach blade on the mic this comeback was looking good
i started getting hot water three more rounds for phase to pick up number one we've got nuke waiting the wings is map too ancient as the third and final
decider if we do need it it's quite the map
face might have to make some adjustments here right they've noted now more often than not that it's fast banana play consistently charging up the multiple
molotovs to make sure they can't play sandbag they can't play mouth for banana room taking off them here and well
here's the little bit of a oopsie from perfecto in the flames goes on down does get that kill
and fired up our face just to be same again here same utility
to be deployed top banana oh that will leave a mark blind on retreat
they do elope still it's perfecto even though he
caught that flack he finds himself at the front of the pack changing that now
reign wants answers get some more than an answer he gets ahead and he's not
done he goes for the full commit and gives away the advantage immediately
look at this wants to change that again oh whoa head on a swivel there's so many options here and he started to find some
safety spotted look at the ankle adopted by electronic he should be cut short and is
navi have solved the mystery twist right now my god look at how many
are income encroaching on to twist location
this is so tacked alive they don't know and twist only gets the one a quick
react out a bit and that will be enough that will be enough to return us to that two-round
gap fans are having real issues with this yeah over towards banana they're having a tough time with things they tried
aggression this time around it hasn't worked and right now for carrigan you're gonna
have to wonder what can we do differently because if your a anchors aren't getting the job done when they're coming to their site then that's big
issues if they're coming towards b and they're brutalizing with utility like there are they're putting pressure on shore this might have to fall to brokey to
take some aggressive stances with the awp here 
no you're consistently getting that bomb down 
osbourne is now in the favor of phase so as far as the buyers go they can do this save by save by at least they can stay
competitive down the home stretch but if navi pulled this one back and we had a massive first half pull from faze
this was their game to lose the fact that they win the pistol reign gets that ace looking absolutely phenomenal right
now they get the conversion in the second but this is the ct side it should be easier for them right here but
they're having a tough time with things it's again rp they want to continue to test this broke with the awp takes a shot he's gonna be pushed off the line
that utility it's so overwhelming and now they know the orbs here
they're getting away with it every time confirm again the orb did not relocate
how both of these d sides from phase and navi are like so imposing
util from navi still plenty of it still up kerrigan staring at a grey
screen flames rattling
twists in a crossfire with his leader to hold and respond to this mid control
ouch carrick goes wide and his eyes fade to black electronic
may have actually screwed that up a little looks good though large smoke presence from navi they are
really slowly strangling this face clan defense
can they find any way to disrupt this or a phase gonna fall like yet again to this navy execute
dividing their time rotator cutting grants looks and he just gets led straight between
the eyes another headshot added to the tally of bit and just as simple as that
can they maintain looks like simple he wants to take more away we'll pay the price
broke you with the information that they are continuing to try and force the issue take everything away from phase
has to be a little bit careful here it's like navier out of the water they can't throw too many bodies at this they might just contain them to be make sure that
they can't leave the site you can see here from electronic they don't want anything else to do with this but this is fantastic work from rv now
they're understanding their setup how to deal with it fazer throwing every trick in the book right now
now these way like that right there was mid retake utility you saw that smoke dribble over top mid they were going from mid retake utility now if you have
the perfect response drop a defensive molotov they can't push up porch side you only have to worry about long side they get that kill
and they get the rounds all right
this is gonna be a story of two t sides 
it's gonna get more broly now right i think that phase have to start taking a couple bit more liberties and fights
they want to take maybe take three towards b extinguish the utility coming their way barrel down banana take a fight
be a bit more aggressive in halls in boiler try and find that pick on the lurker towards second mid because right now it's not the same fashion in the way
that faze were able to pick up their t rounds but navi are doing similar scenes they're getting control of the map much earlier and then they're applying this
pressure to phase and the individuals they're not standing up right now
big round of play boomic blind catching knees catching
flack he's already very very low but still face fly their flag top banana oh what a flash
no punish carrigan that wants answers again
rain tucked in close hoping
to find that early advantage that has alluded faze clan
so stubborn and that's a little loopsy we do see
starting to run out of the additional utility they've just forced out so much early here sure rain has a little bit left over that's the best they have to
boast right now is navi they are looking threatening here grouped up ready to go
first map of the pgl nature grand final number one
versus number two reigning champs release the nades 
keeping them guessing kerrigan thinking it through may have over
thought it says here they come it's twist and ray nice headshot
finding two on the entrance it's a third and a rain repels but it's not done yet bits makes
it so bomb needs to be planted oh he saves them as well it becomes a
two on two this is winnable despite the heroics of rain navi
pulled back into the fray from perfecto and bit it's the a players now from phase
trying to find a way back in oh no bad smoke
on the hunt perfecto the healthiest member of this retake and he still stands up
a second and that'll do no recover phase did everything let me correct
myself reign did everything and it's still for nothing
three kills from a b defender chad and it does not translate into a round again perfecto i
i can't stop saying his name right those impact kills late if kerrigan swings on out spams into the box the bomb gets
dropped there's no time left perfecto here is the safe pair of hands that navy need in this comeback you saw bits
health as well if perfecto isn't as precise as this right here look at that such a huge kill
oh perfecto refuses to surrender will not bow out of this and we're all
tied up all tied up after an explosive start from faze navi
they have found their footing
perfecto 22.
it's brokey who puts him down this time quick clawed back in this battle for banana endlessly
waging on and there's pressure being applied all over the map electronic flirting with
the fading smoke and fines nobody home
this is early to be having so much of this territory a well-placed molly but it's rob slips off another from brokey
two in the round on that defensive orb he may need more as twist has gone down and he's gone down as well bit drive by
on to brokey and carrigan
demanded to clutch or navi will seize control and take the lead
on inferno
23 now
feels strange to say this but it's phase individuals on the ct side they're not stepping up with the multi kills they require they're knocking on the door
they're coming into their bomb sites but they're not able to convert multiple kills one is not enough because the trading right now is better from navi
they're playing as a unit they're believing in this comeback and they are getting fired up look it's simple they're 14 13 now navi take the lead an
ao start for phase it means nothing as navy want to rip this one away this
could be heartbreaking considering how close how ridiculously close face felt
and on the ct side no less now a nervous gulp
for this international roster as they can feel it slipping away simple
again finds the opening
it's not a pretty buy it's the best they could bust up they've rifled behind the sofa cushions
come up with nothing more than a couple of pistols a singular mp9 carrigan
with just a c-set and a whole squad chasing him he does
get two two on a pistol is there really something to be said
about round 28 there shouldn't be rookie bit premature
smoke down we need it they've got the time to think it through
wait for the smokes to fade no boosts to be seen
apart from this one right here oh i rarely see a t side adopt that
it's given time though for robs to be somewhat of a arrival oh he needed that a bit again
now the plant is safe enough only a p250 and that's navi up to 15
two map points
just so steady here under pressure every single time it looks like navi might be in a bit of trouble here they just bowed
himself out they look calm they hit the brakes they wait they hit the necessary shots and phase they can't find anything
they make it interesting sure carrigan with the double here but this is such a comeback right now
eight zero start 15 to 13 the score reads kerrigan and inferno
this might haunt him forever 10 rounds and it may not be enough
they've got three on the defense three is all they could muster unless
is this going to be the final round of our first map of this grand final
sport police thinks it may be quick shot through the smoke aggressive banana control phase are starting to
look like their former cells at least in the early posturing a little bit different here finally
banana control right now the phase how long can they hold on to that defensive smoke alongside might be the gap here twist as well now under pressure
defensive utility drop rotation starting to come in navi have a lot of space and a lot of time
easy to second-guess yourself this much pressure on your shoulders
twist responsible combination with carrick potentially going to be the dane
start his spray twins no one provides a response
they have the numbers now on the commit kerrigan trigger happy it's broken sort of that
manages to find something but already he's been silenced navi's trades are so strong against the market two again
does not surrender and simple at the end of the day we go again
it had to be someone carrick it's the one to pull up his socks and spray down
three oh felt like he was just trying to bait a little bit of a room for his team right there but having to do it all the
in-game leader oh boy last time out it's the last time
out in the last round should we go ot they won't have that option but that remains to be seen
it's one of the first rounds since the very very early stage of this second half that faze have been able to get full banana control
that's the difference maker right there they're able to hedge they're able to get the rotation in they responded in time sure they lost the opening killer
twist but carrigan makes up for that but this is it round number 30 map number one the buyers are in for both teams now
v they want to get it done 16-14 and faze want to take it to overtime
here it is again look at number three first two great that's simple on an orb here and bang back
kerrigan extends play can they repeat that though they've been
few and far between sandwiched amongst five navi rounds and carrick decides he will take matters
into his own hand raid aggressive banana and it looks like it carrick is afraid
 and it's too big now to recover navi off kilter
down a man bleeding and asking questions as to where the cts may have borrowed themselves into they have to clear
they're going to take time to do this uncertainty in the natives vince here come now and a man to the good buffets
and for ot what a play-to-bank right here from kerrigan aggressive maneuver only gets one out of it but has thrown this round
into a towel spin navi being good in these number disadvantaged situations but this time they have no space to work
with combing back through the map looking for any cts who are overstepping the mark right now but a two-two split of
the defenses and navi if they hit the side together they'll have the man advantage their trading has been on point
it's been very hard to get a frank get away brokey would love that here in our 30th
plays a conservative understandably so so much attached to a single round of
counter strike first half but they are finding the frags simple indeed
lots more like it took us a while to warm into this one
but it's bloody hot in here now antwerp 
i think we discussed how close and how dreamy of a grand final this is chad and we go 15-15 on our first map of this
grand final  mr three 10k now notch onto the board
here oh simple this that second shot yeah phenomenal stuff there the one on
the twist is beautiful tried to play it smart tried to be tricky rox keeping his cool as per the namesake gets the final
kill and here we go again
the aggression the balls to go for a maneuver like that i really don't know who has that momentum now it felt like
navi really did awaken on that second half phase though proved to themselves that
it's not done little change up out of the defense here be interesting to see how far rain gets
he's been having his troubles he's been having his woes but still looks to stand up tall maybe not anticipating this one carrigan
reads the flash turns it to perfectionary smoke on banana will maintain control but upon the fade maybe
more to be done oh my god i don't know if he knows perfecto
looking right see him it's carrick
a lot of utility drawn out from phase here finally an aggressive maneuver to take
some space it might just walk straight into this one is bit stank stoic no overstepping the line right now as the rest of his team work on space elsewhere
region this defense twists back over towards the second letter of the alphabet joining reign who's perched up pretty
info could be name of the game here four phase if they do want to test the limits dip their toe into the water they'll
know exactly where this fight's coming if not it's all on twisted rain to lock this one down yeah they're staying so
static distinct number advantage for navi
and they set their sights on the second letter of the alphabet it's rain again who should so great success first in the
scope it ain't done yet
electronic tasks with a one versus two clutch on the
greatest of and stages got one already but brookie
right behind the latvian holds fast
26 that puts him on top of the table 
the very first from his nation to stand on a stage like this an opponent like this one round the first of overtime
goes phase his way definitely faze have re-found himself here right it was looking bleak for a while they were passive they thought
they were just going to walk this one across the line but you can see carrigan starting to look like himself more aggressive maneuvers getting stuck here
taking some fights taking some liberties gets them the opener right there does get traded out but search fades up in
the mantle of four round four but we're getting real close now in some of these rounds
rv back into the bike back in with this banana aggression all that you till the smoke to extinguish
anything coming their way perfecto this time around we'll just take all the space all the control again this wasn't
noted last time round so faze opting to rob some brokey up for success
it's very well drilled by taking all that space immediately fazer force to start dumping
hey cheese defensive flashes
twists buys time with flame on the floor in mid it's gonna test this
he wants to oh broken he's been waiting for it this long time but dropped 180 to
the dover's bits gone they look for arms in mid but boom rich
holds one there should be a response in brokey faze have the advantage but they don't
have all the answers and simple catches rocks on his adventures
cut short off last broken disrespects the smoke
and keeps faze hopes of a second on the ct side
of overtime  it's simple a perfecto
no better pairing 49 already
just between the two of them and it is simple to test those waters up again rain the pre-aim
leaves us right into the deadlock of a two-on-two and
strike
looking to be the oldest player to win a major title carrigan steps up when the
team needs him most flatline simple takes out perfecto and puts faze back into the winning ways
here two more now required this trading out of brokie here he's just all across the shop trying to find all this space
he gets it and look at this carrick wasn't ready for it but able to adjust gets the kill ready for perfecto finds
the frag and simple's frustrated with that one this comeback for now v maybe it was all
for now enough money to buy again the plants being there run boost across mid here in
delivery of the awp neither shot connects valiant attempts final round of their
defensive half oh low t the stubborn norwegian backed up
flash to support facilitate this he's aggressive and yet punished
it's perfecto gives na'vi a man advantage very early
goes back to the tuck shop returns with plenty of goodies
might get a real shock here right yeah he may not be prepared for something this vicious
straight away already completely nullified what can he contribute to staring at a smoke and
loads his mag nothing to report and already it seems navi
have set themselves up for success a bomb down and a spray heavy
into the first defender the first responder a deeper smoke
will rise frustrations trying to solve this on the fly a phase a little bit of summing for twists he
thought he caught up of navi but still five alive
what could rob possibly do you'd need something rather crazy and simple it says no this is here there is
one for navi an electronic makes it so a triple to end it faze just throwing everything they could
see what sticks a 2-1 division
17 to 16. this is actually huge for face thinking about how few and far between the ct rounds can the fact that they get
two out of the three possible here on their ct side we know how good these t rounds were but the question is
have these teams been able to solve the puzzle of the t rounds now that has to be asked for navi as they're going to flick on over they're going to be on the
defensive side and fey is going to continue with the slow default spread it's all so long ago
right now but if you missed it it was just faze with these very slow crawls map control buying their time
trying to target that arch side early and then they had to change within the final few rounds of play but that's where navi did come alive it felt within
the tail end of that first half they had solved the puzzle and that orp of simple was a key component it's out here to play
what can we see off of that opening break an orb for either side the zoom bangers
may very well clash simple things better of it
russia from the cts
certainly has been the name of the game a choke pulled over banana and the b
bomb site
phase lay down the game plan change the state of play 20 seconds on
the smokes what do they do what do they build out of this they're just crawling right behind them smokes it already
simple caught off completely bamboozled only bit would need to do something
really crazy because faze they have managed to put
the 18th on the board unless pumice and perfecto
have anything to contribute it seems he does boom takes down carrick and he's reading the
play but back turns and twists spanx 
oh he spotted him out rocks will close we have our 18. navi up against the ropes battered
and bloody it's a real turnaround from kerrigan here's up to 24 kills the second highest for his team this home
stretch that they have been on he has come alive he has stepped up in a massive way he didn't want to go down on
a map like this inferno in a major grand final could not haunt him again and here showing us exactly why up and over takes out the
big man himself simple down the second on the electronic is perfect and the third on to bit phenomenal stuff right
here carrigan cracks it open it looks like we might have cracked navi here as well
pulling out all the stops chip damage margin pereira
zero for navi
constant battle for this part of the map
the t-side of phase was very potent
they're still coming that's not enough to ward them off here this could be the finish for faze that ao start they want to do it right here right now and ot
number one their map choice and they must have been hot under the collar
after navi showed just how powerful they are there's doubt
from navi right now they're not quite sure where this one's going to finish simple's just being called off he was floating over the goat he's been called
to stop by now and it's just going to be on bemidji perfecto they have to get this done they need a multi kill they need all the frags perfecto good for it
perfecto he has held faze at the door and his friend tries to change the
dialogue 20 seconds where on earth can they find a way in
15 as they really look to change of course the rotated
three on three bumps down 40 seconds already ticking away here they need to get a move on they're all out of position all rotating through the same
corridor fazer set up to shut this one down take map one right here right now rocks made
this possible smoke to allow this gap to close bomb is half gone navi's hopes and
dreams with it a couple of kills is all they need and there's one simple snowman rob speaks
his fate and he's only broken to pull faith across the line
 everyone
every single member of our stage thought they had it at one point phase though
leave with the first map of this grand final over time on map one
