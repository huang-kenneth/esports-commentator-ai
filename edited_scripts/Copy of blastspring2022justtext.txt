quarterfinals continue here in lisbon at the blast premiere spring finals navi up one to nothing in this series of just an incredible first map a dominant first map in phase it's their turn to recover surely is we're going to be playing on inferno so if there's a good chance i think the face could do a lot of work here but what uh what a what a grotesque start to the day yeah well i think the nice thing about this map we saw it on dust  navi just controlling the entire pace of that game from the t side to start with but inferno as we saw yesterday against g this is kind of what prompted me to say that that faze had played such an aggressive game this map in particular kerrigan was pushing down mid constantly they were harassing down banana they were really able to disrupt g's t side they're gonna need another look like that here on inferno when they do eventually switch over to the ct side you cannot let navi just dictate all the pace every single round for  rounds we'll see what they can bring in because they're facing elimination here in the playoffs already a bit early for the number one team in the world yes it is welcome to inferno speaking of early yeah romps another one of those i didn't even see him just straight and dead oh he's that's so unreasonable get one more one more one tap oh he's trying isn't he he really wants it it's so stupid isn't it what do you even do he hasn't even reloaded yet no he's got the magic magazine yeah all right there we go okay calm down don't turn around when you're behind that smoke that's not a wall it's not gonna stop bullets but still sticking around for more and now he sees two coming in banana he's done his work he's gotten two kills but he knows he's got one behind him good flashbang setup way to pull them up banana and go back for it but can't land the shots and now it's time to give it away entirely yeah but they can smoke it off and if you buy a little bit more time just make it uncomfortable and electronic expansion push all the way up with the dually so if they cross back on this side of the map they're going to be found out no matter what the question is is he going to pull the trigger with those dualies at that range you know like that's not a good place for it  seconds brokey and rain all the way towards ultimate just to make sure nobody's pushed up they're coming back to banana they're gonna hit the b bomb site no matter what yep they just wanted to check that they weren't being immediately flanked it doesn't matter even if they were like they're still going to be three players at the b bomb site but you can understand the idea just making sure there's no fast flank a couple of miss shots now from simple there we go another headshot make it a triple and he finally goes down but bit is here to take over and he's a fourth player in ct spawn not even needed this time around good defense good start to inferno for navi and that's just that's one of those rounds where simple is just on one and he wants to stay aggressive and banana and just everyone else nearby him is just playing support you have bit with those flash bangs with the smoke as well to follow it up and nothing faze can do yeah tough beginning but i mean it is a pistol round that shoot that that can happen when we get to the second half i mean something else that's really worth thinking about is if navi are gonna be playing as slow as they did on the t side of dust if they try that on this map they can get slowed down way more because of the grenade usage right so it might impact them a lot more if they try and play that same style it won't be that slow right because you know they have to at least be able to pressure to force out some nades so there's going to be more and more engagements well some deagles on the board lonely tec- on rops see if they could do some damage here i mean we it just felt like maybe some of the later rounds broken at a pretty good round with the awp but we just didn't see them i mean the the desks were talking about it in between the in between the the two maps here just they have so much firepower on that team and it just didn't feel like it at all no they didn't get to really utilize any of it in any kind of great way now the prospect of starting t-side on inferno to keep your playoff dreams alive to stay alive in this quarterfinal series they know the position of reign dualies are out good kill from brokey but so much attention taking over towards rap side simple somehow manages an impossible situation again and again perfecto with those dualies at a library gets the final kill good transfer from simple that's one way to put it yeah i i thought he was dead like  times over when he got pulled that far pop pop yeah yeah he's out in the open right there so it could have been dangerous but they controlled the situation pretty well got deagles and tech 's back on the side of phase so see if they can do a little bit more damage once again maybe get rid of some of those mps oh simple already hitting the ground headshot from kerrigan they're being very aggressive in the middle and with the pistols on the other side it's so hard to control someday young coming in to help out and drops hasn't really signaled yet but they have a really good idea they might have heard him step somewhere because they seem to be sure of it good quick three rounds in favor of na'vi i'll tell you what if this first gun run from phase isn't isn't clean i'm gonna start feeling worried not maybe not clean but if it's if it's if they get dominated in this round i'm i'm really worried that phases just come in flat on a day where navi comes in real hot let's see what they've got here aks are out on the board no awp on brokey not unusual for t side inferno and probably didn't have the money frankly but here we go yeah i know what you mean though i i would i would start to feel the same way it's just it's looking scary right now for the phase side of things maybe for everybody else in the tournament too this is a kind of navi you really don't want to face let's see maureen has already been fairly aggressive looking up in those apartments hanging around trying to see if we can find any kind of an opening for his team they're early with that awp on simple so if they try to go for a jump or he's thinking about it could have pulled the trigger right then against the molotov i mean it's possible to try and get the timing down but gonna fall back and wait to reveal that weapon over on the side of the map this is a great looking navi for a team that dropped a series earlier in the event against og to open it up but in that series a one to two loss for navi they did win inferno  to seven three players of the b bomb site for now including simple with the op someday young and pit electronic playing the rotational position at the moment stepping in front of the rap side smoke perfect flashbang by himself i believe rain gets the trade but the b bomb site is under attack tight angle was simple but rain crouches right into it huge opening right there if rain could have somehow even just stayed alive it would have pulled simple and sort of kept him over on this side of the map but now they're ready  seconds trying to come through the smoke but there's just so much defense on the other side here perfecto with a nice double kill and simple will take that headshot every single time that is a very clean defense coming out right here okay i'm worried that's that's the one i'm i'm worried for phase right now not only because of phase looking a little bit flat so far in these opening two maps and obviously still very early on in inferno but navi had this read the whole time i mean even electronic was playing in ct spawn with simple as a third player at the b bomb site already a lot of faith in some day young alone in pitt but they had the perfect reads the perfect utility usage to counter everything that phase is doing so navi's got a very good feel for the game at the moment it feels like it doesn't it they need somebody to oh good block electronic that's a good read again it's it's so strange to watch when you think about the firepower that see think any almost any of these players would be able to to swing and challenge some of these navi players and just create an opening in a random round but they're not we're not feeling the the impact of that right now i'm not feeling the confidence really like navi really like dust feels like navi really put faze in their place and now i mean faze has to work up the courage to kind of get themselves back into things tech nines this is gonna be a fast-paced hit right off the back of utility usage at some day young blind up on the balcony simple's got a blind kill and another one inside the bomb site he's eventually gonna get wrapped up on but electronics here for support and again no access whatsoever for faze they get the one kill and that's it three headshots from electronic assault with that ma so pretty quick with it only six kills for faze in the first five rounds of this map it's fine that kerrigan slips the net because simple's got enough kills to activate electronic through the smoke to pull it right back first timeout used by faze early as they go into their second full buy of the half maybe it's the new haircut it could be um the i would call the backstreet boys return yeah sure nick carter style doesn't have the frosted tips i don't think that comes later that comes later yeah um somebody something to work towards listen it's all fashion is all circular isn't it you've said it wait wait long enough and it's coming right back come right back okay i'll open the hands of brokey up in the hands of simple of course round number six does he want to go for the challenge he tries but simple's on the other side in many ways larger than life himself jason well done thanks i hate you bit with the kill down banana as well simple again look at this defense two players of the eight bomb said even with one picked off no one's in any kind of a rush to rotate over towards a simple's all on his own as he's maintaining aggression with that op in quad electronic and perfecto rotating over three versus four a lot of damage on but simple will take down rain rock his body right stop it you stop that right now simple maintaining aggression gets another one and that's an impossible kill to recover from for simple but rops really has nowhere to go bit slow on hp he's picked at the bomb  seconds this would be one of those clutches that you feel would breathe some energy into the team and get phased back into the game but he's a long way from that electronic in pit  seconds he's doable with the time that's left but he does need he needs to surprise someone that has to be the way this starts quick kill on one player try to isolate the next fight before the third rotation comes in  seconds and he's just not getting any vision on anyone and he's he's pretty far out right now could be so confusing then why am i not seeing even anybody there's the look but it takes too long and electronic will take him down nice attempt from robs i don't know what he's supposed to do he he needs he needs some vision on someone and it just takes  seconds to review can find that simple is just a one-man defense at the a bomb site this whole time he just holds it so strong brokey a little frustrated the follow-up peak this was great nobody to trade rain off in here as well one kill on kerrigan but he's not getting away from rops what are you supposed to do against that face just getting picked apart in a way that doesn't allow them to work together to take the map control afterwards yeah i don't know jason but much worse faze don't know why yeah that that part seems apparent what an interesting day i i looking at the schedule today i thought this is going to be two bangers two yeah real close games yeah give me like six overtimes today give me two three mappers it could that's probably what you felt like that's what it should have been i can hear production crying right now at the thought yes they did have some long days some long days well hull's pop it's a classic kerrigan setting up one there's a second flashbang coming as well we'll see if it's going to be good enough with the tech nines behind it flashes are kind of already worn off so i don't know if they went quite deep enough good kill there from robs but they need more and he's not going to be able to with the simple will take him down already and now that it's slowed down i mean for this strategy to work you need the early kill you need to be down on the floor of that pit otherwise it's not going to be fast enough and backup will show up simple ain't losing today you want to talk about some day young coming in as just uh i mean i guess i don't even know what to call it really not really a standard but i guess a try out perhaps would be a more accurate way to phrase it i already got some of the protocols down pop flash comes in he gets blind makes his presence known on balcony drops but tucks himself close to the wall so that nobody can see him nobody can pick him off and that's where simple is able to come from the broken wall and cover his position beautifully done seven to nothing they've tried almost everything phase except for the head desk slam that's yet to be um packed out here for the phase side of things something to think about really roki gets a kill to open it up with but kerrigan gets taken down it's a nice attempt to commit it oh charlie you've got to say it's close that actually i actually think that was that was a really nice attempt from carrick look at the damage that he did he had a molotov behind him he had almost no space to work with and he nearly got that kill not a not a bad try but just not working again look at the emphasis though three players at the b bomb site with over with well over a minute left in the round some die young alone in pit i think this round phase might have sussed it out i have no idea he's alone but at least they're making the right call even if it is blind if you drop this round because remember electronic and bit if if this a-hold isn't strong they're saving they're not they're not moving out of these positions in the b-bomb site so it's all on perfecto's decision as he rotates over and it's all on some die young and pit they do have a molotov as well actually two molotovs so they could they could firebomb him out and that would be the real play yeah there we go down under the bicycle someday young at least that smoke will give him a little bit of space to work with and he goes aggressive this is a smart move and he gets a head shot on rain on top and now they're so far away if they would have been closer i mean they're still going to try and run a little bit closer right now but if they would have even been in ct spawn here they'd just go for it right away i don't know if i see a world in which you actually go for this such low hp on electronic a bit they stopped running i don't think brookie's heard them they are right behind him in the middle in the app now he's thinking about it comes back in already scoped up and even took a minute to get that one back for povecto and now it's definitely done so that was a from some youngest point of view that's a really cool defense and the fact that that smoke that's a tea smoke that they may they want to cross in and get the bomb down but he uses it as a way to actually go and fight electronic oh surely no way no way he's gonna go for it nope he'd come back for him and he's not gonna win the round but he did make it real expensive okay i was gonna say yeah broke his way too close to let that one happen but yeah losing all the weapons even in victory is so tough look at the buy you're gonna have coming out of a victory that's gotta be painful good shot from brokey simple a little overexposed looking towards old mid and also closing the round out shutting down the retake before it begins wow okay time out from navi this time as they want to talk things over they've still got plenty of cash after this buy they've got a good money a good amount of money build up but still i i mean again another round i don't think phase they might have kind of caught on to it this time but maybe they would assume it's because of the damage just a heavy lean from navi's defense towards the b-bomb site they're really entrusting solo players at a it it feels like right now in the media game a lot you can get away with that because so hard for the t sign to figure out what's happening you can do those b-leans really i mean in the beginning people just did it and they ran back so they had like three people throwing grenades and they ran back but it's like that time kept getting extended more and more and now people realize well we can actually keep three but for a real long time yeah um because it's it's real unlikely that someone's gonna rush the a bomb side on this map it's not something that happens a lot so symbols looking down the middle again they still have some money in the bank navi even after that uh that last round bits trying to navigate all the fire and flames that's up here no one on the other side to catch at the moment so battle for banana continues he's gonna slowly back on out he did have perfecto ready with flashbangs in hand if he needed it so good control for faze at least they have banana yeah that's something something to work off of just stop still three people here it's gonna transfer into the bomb site simple is gonna get aggressive timing shot doesn't land that's when the m swings out he's trying to keep them at bay good nate from simple as well and perfecto lying in wait yeah back to the bottom side he just has to stay alive and by a little bit of time or even better than that if he gets a kill on top but he's the only one on the bomb side so if he dies too quick then those smokes are still going to be up and there could be a bomb behind it waiting inside though perfecto is playing this rock solid at the moment nice triple frame here and simple flash doesn't even matter he saw robs beforehand there's another good defense and another round where they had three in that bomb side yeah and i i mean they're catching phase off guard completely even even with that initial kill the initial one for one you have to feel faze was excited about that one and a perfect support flashbang from simple to allow perfecto for this peak up high in the sky along the roof above him ad navi's just playing this perfectly we mentioned the beginning of the series teams making the fewest mistakes possible navi is just playing an excellent fundamental game yeah truly - right now for simple that is a horrifying sight for anyone on the phase side electronic gonna open it up they're trying to see if they can switch it back and wrap around the arch but simple it doesn't wanna maybe find that with an awp did throw out a flashbang and bit is there to take over some of his duties controlling arch so still not bad the series is done phase ain't coming back in this one certainly doesn't feel like it no they look they look done entirely yeah you can see even just the amount of control that that simple has over some of these rounds i'm gonna be so impressed if they muster up a comeback here nine to one quart kill for bit but still simple in the lead  kills out here saying i want it that way jason yeah yeah she's ready to get down your appreciation with backstreet boys traxxas i don't know anything about what i thought it was i don't know anymore what kind of kind of guy  degrees i know the names of the bands that's about it i don't really know the songs yeah i guess so i'll take that loss and so will phase apparently yeah um nine to one is yeah not even the score line i think what you're saying is the look and feel of it here yeah just just eye test of the way navi is dominating this all the right reads all the right rotations all the right utility usage and i mean just even after that you're just winning the straight up duels yeah they're not even falling back from that fight in the apartment it's like yeah but i'm just going to stick around and keep the battle going oh nice find from kerrigan calm awkward position but yes dui probably can't really hang around the boiler room forever to try and hold it and maybe a chance here yeah but this position from some day young is just so strong to make it awkward in the post plant yeah they have to worry about that while they're being pushed from the other side oh nice small it's all kerrigan with a headshot he's gonna have to do just a little bit more flash over someday making a lot of noise running down that's an easy shot for kerrigan to hit but does he realize perfecto's already out crouching in and he gets the head shot it's a nice attempt a triple kill for carrigan nearly getting that clutch but it's not enough yeah i mean almost a great recovery in the round as well uh considering the way it started i think it was what like a three on five two on five at one point when simple and some day young get finished with this i think a two on five is the correct answer as he's going to get a second kill right here so reign and kerrigan almost pull it back but that position from some day young just keeps kerrigan pinned down on the bomb site keeps it so difficult from knowing what's coming next definite frustration and you can't even blame them for it no i mean this is a round they try and pick up the pace towards the a bomb site right and then all of a sudden instead of b like they've seen most of the half it's simple pushed up in halls some day young pushed up in holes and you have a third defender on rap side so what are you supposed to do you can't even get the right read of what defense you're going against at any point during these rounds crazy isn't it i did not expect this navi today that's a great looking chicken yeah good coloring that's as your favorite chicken that's a handsome chick well not no emotional response of actually boys but the chickens take what that we will members of the audience simple nice warbang yeah they he's been so ready to go for that kind of aggression that rain sees that smoke like i don't know what this is so good start to the round here for phase they've used a lot of nades here twist hasn't even turned the corner yet see if there's the flash for perfecto oh smoke is down right as that happens but bit is still feeling it he knows he's put the pressure on twist is on the other side he wants to go finding these sneaks around surely he's gonna lose this fight oh he's got him locked in that's actually kerrigan twist stays alive somehow but that is wild they're they're so aggressive they're so ready to do and the confidence is just with na'vi right now oh yeah absolutely that that push seemed insane especially when didn't get complete the kill on twists you imagine they'd be ready for that kind of peek around the edge of the smoke but still grabs one more frag navi gonna pull everyone over to the a bomb site all three players you're doubled in pit and perfecto is now coming out of library into the a bomb site so if phase do eventually pull the trigger here they're in for a world of hurt you would feel like again it's not fair because you feel like this is this is our round you know three versus four and you're going to be walking into a stacked perfecto already spotting them out when they see him though they there should be a giveaway but i don't know if they have time they don't now  seconds they can't really backtrack easily to the b bomb site so even if they found out it's not going to matter now they're walking into a trap right here oh it's heartbreaking headshot comes through perfected with a double and it's all been shut down brokey nine seconds and he cannot win the rounds sdy taking him down and there's nothing that's working up for phase right here no navi's making all the right decisions on a team level on like the macro level of the entire team and rotating across the map and pulling out stacks at the right moment but also the individual decisions perfecto having some attention out towards rap side and just says i'm falling into the bombsite electronic watch my rap you're in pit you're doubled up you have the new the new angle on that and him and someday young just set up a perfect crossfire i think even even when they watch this back i think there are going to be some rounds where karen and kerrigan's just like these are like blind reads from navi like don't even know if we gave up all the information needed yeah and that's that's true right if they went back and look at the demo i'm sure that's what they find out they'll be like alright well yes they just roll the dice on that one and it just worked out twist good takedown of bit flashed into that fight he did nearly die himself but it's worth it well if you can't win this round with some opening kills why are you trying to change them i just like to watch it watch the world burn well there's a good chance right here certainly going to be a lot of discussion around this uh this phase team afterwards because it's not the first sign of weakness that we've seen in the tournament that's why they're in the quarter-finals to begin with oh no that can't be real smackdown rookie and kerrigan get blown up rops if you can't say it again jason oh my lord they haven't even gotten a follow they haven't done a point of damage after the opening kill the nade strike in mid is so brutal drops left in a v i don't really have words to describe it any longer there goes electronic but simple's here and he hasn't been missing much this game yeah that's one way to yeah nice utility usage exactly that's the first and the follow-up from some dai young absolutely perfect for a double devastating add a model  on top you know just in case just in case yeah what a contrast laughing and giggling on the navi side and silence and no emotion on the face side yeah well probably are some emotions but oh there we go they're trying to try to give it a back there's some good knee damage i don't know if it'll make a difference but but you can just tell like the kind of thought process from phase two is there just like you know we haven't really been able to get firm control of banana throughout this half like we've never had it we've never really been able to neutralize the aggression effectively enough to feel comfortable yeah i top fragger on the face side is broken eight kills bottom fragger on the other team is bit with nine so yeah that says a lot something's wrong twelve to one i picked faze today as well i need him to quit playing games with my heart oh thank god we're only doing one game today double kill from simple gonna keep navi in the man advantage four to three and he's gonna go back for more surely he's not gonna stop surely he just doesn't care oh and it's a freebie close to the corner it's in no scope i'm sorry we're not laughing at face this is so ridiculous i'm laughing a little bit oh why is he doing it he's got the quad kill he's a one away from picking up that awb ace but it seems like electronics probably gonna get there first and uh that would be annoying wouldn't it kerrigan running in oh are they gonna try it almost looks like electronic was holding his trigger there it will in the end be a another round for navi  to . oh dear yeah and they already think this is clear right i guess teammates are already admitted he thinks there's no way someone's peeking oh excuse me that was the first kill he's just jumping up this is the one where they already thought it was clear twists had no idea and robs can't do anything about the trade you know there are some games that we talk about and players talk about and i've experienced where simple's just going off in a way where you can't beat them no matter what you do the problem here is simple is having that kind of a game but so are the other four players on his team yeah yep yes i don't it's not there's no weak link you can spot right now it just doesn't and the only reason bit probably has nine kills that he's been doing just you know a lot more utility work and hasn't been he's been flashing people in along with perfecto maybe so they've just been a little bit more bored but like it's the domination is so so complete from navi on on these two maps that we've played that the only two maps will play in this series essentially that i believe that i don't even really take anything away negative about phase at the moment like i can't even like say like yeah they've had a slow event yeah they've they've been a little shoddy in this tournament yeah like you know it's just been navi just has all the right answers at the moment nothing's going wrong for him okay a little bit of a head shot yeah this does seem like it's a it's a hard match to to maybe take too much away from other than the fact that navi and simple are looking red hot right now he's smoking it off looking for a bit more no tried to do it again he really tried didn't he i believed i felt it i thought it was coming that would have been freakish well he's been doing it all game so i mean everyone everyone was feeling that one  seconds bro keep one versus two even the horses are getting nervous in the background we'll try it for a little bit there brookie looking for anything again i mean he's playing this right way he wants to isolate an intro one on one but he just can't do it electronic will take him down it is a  to one victory in the first half in favor of navi that is shocking we'll see what happens in the second half it's coming up right after well that is the mood a little bit on phase empty use them using size on that side yeah we're back with the second half and it's the second map and a   chance for uh for face to win yeah that's how it works they are the win to lose  . i went to university jason i know how this one yeah yeah um we'll see this series went live at   p.m local time it's uh it's now like what  . this might be like a record for one of the fastest bos we've had in a long time yep you're not wrong although electronic goes down at the beginning here so let's see if they can find a little bit more kerrigan's out fighting one banana fit with a bit of a return perfect with a nice headshot as well oh my lord wow they're chewing them up under they're not even gonna give them a chance to get into the second half brokey flash doesn't do that much but it doesn't matter simple's out on the hunt finding a second kill of the round drops down in the middle bomb is gonna be planted and even worse yeah perfecto is there to already spot him out so not much he could do i think i think i saw at the bottom the odds were  to . i think it's probably even worse than that we probably don't even they probably don't even have a graphic that goes higher than that yeah oh man  kills on simple in regular in the first half in the first half alone please is absolutely crazy he was incredible i the whole navi team was just incredible from from just a general bigger larger picture perspective this is how this is how the the internet came up with the with the insult of people try harding right because if you can't win at least you can at least you can say you can make them feel ashamed for being good yeah at least i didn't try as much as you did yeah at least i didn't invest more time yeah you really want to win then fine whatever take it you rat they're having such a good time on the navi side i'm so i'm so amazed by this i think i think you're right this is this is the kind of game especially against a team like faze where it's got to put the rest of the field on notice like look this is the navi that's coming to play in the playoffs as the navi that's going to be on the stage tomorrow good luck and i believe the winner of this plays og uh yeah you might be right about that i should probably confirm that before i say things out loud fine just make it sorry yes the winner of this plays og i was right nicely done so rematch for navi strike back from the opening map of the uh opening series of the event for them get some revenge yeah that actually could be a lot of fun i that that makes me really happy i'd love to see that uh that rematch happened that could be an interesting scenario see if navier gonna be if they're back in this form i don't even know what it'll take well and you want to talk about another good opera that's sitting on a little bit of a hot streak from from the major and even before that whose name is starting popping up more and more dexter standing in for mantu and the og lineup like uh let's see a dexter versus simple battle could be fun  seconds now four versus three and isolated in the bomb site all on his own fighting with the mp it's robs good double kill for him it's not bad by a little bit of time rain goes down though teammates trying to get here but it won't matter . to . navi they send faze packing like it was nothing they might have packed their bags for them they're vey's getting back to the hotel
