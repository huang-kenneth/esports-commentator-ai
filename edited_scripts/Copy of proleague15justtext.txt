these occasions oh yeah they have simple's got the dualies matt we're back into it okay thanks that's my hype cassidy's going to be a little bit better but we're starting the same way as always we're getting right into it simple is going to push out with those julies towards top banana a little bit of information but he got too much information that's information he didn't want to have taken out of  hp perfecto as he gets shot in the forehead i'm going to back away slightly not out of this yet but he's going to be so passive and that is actually it almost feels like that might bust up navi's plans it looked like they wanted oh there it is peeking down first kill under robs felt like navi wanted to rotate a fourth player over you could see boomish in ct spawn at the moment with perfecto and  hp they might not be able to keep that player cheated this far over they might have to consider rotating him back especially as this smoke blooms at left mid gutsy to leave perfecto alone super gutsy butts it is the pit position and we know he's super accurate there's no utility in the pistol maybe that's part of the gamble as well you'd expect a nade oh there is all the top it was in the air as i said that so i didn't identify it on the hud my apologies twists will burn them alive that's exactly what i was gonna say they might be worried about in a regular round twists on it already we'll take down boomich not before he got brokey but the advantage by kerrigan in the exchange for the site not the round overall though it's a two on two no timing simple's gonna be too far gone he's not gonna slow down i don't know if twists will get behind him and get a clean kill but he will certainly get behind him when he does start to go down inside of the site easy peasy twist gonna make the head shot count as simple didn't want to jump out couldn't figure out why he hadn't spotted anyone electronics still with the advantage in terms of the news oh my god twist just wanted to keep him off the poem that's a  wonder lewis is trying to keep him off it and go back and hide but he realizes he's got electronics back to him so he commits to it that's massive what a turnaround shot from electronic absolutely brilliant in a pistol round for navi great job all the way through i thought this might seal it twist with three kills in the round just couldn't find electronic look at this you don't see this every day twist recommits and electronic just a quick one tap shout out to boomik as well the flashbang over pit to the back of pit behind perfecto's back blinds the player that's meant to clear him as he's evacuating the molotov allows him to get that kill and even though he burns alive perfecto getting one with  hp is fantastic deep mid-smoke remember we've seen simple do that run boost to peak around it and peek towards old mid so that might be setting up that play as we go deeper into this game if they keep seeing that smoke and not use they might get lulled into a false sense of security that's the philosophy behind it so twists with all the kills but none of the glory yeah exactly that gets onto the ak try and do something of it banana we often talk about this though in the counter-strike landscape the better buy teas despite losing it because of the bomb going down simple will be certainly aware of this fact especially when you're up against someone like kerrigan you know he's going to call for it uh yeah he even mentioned that interview he's like it's always the same against kerrigan i don't know if i'd believe that but in simple's mind a battle of individual prowess and knowing they have to be on point boomers and perfecto to defend they do have a molotov it's gonna be dropped down right now that's gonna buy time for simple that seven seconds brings simple over he's blocked off by the smoke for the moment they're running low on utility still one flashbang left and oh boomish is gonna go down good spray from brokey through the smoke sample can't get anything in fact he loses his life okay with the kill perfecto to respond but twists comes in with the ak and finds another making it now a two-man advantage electronic and bit this time may have to back off of it flash out quick peak mp nothing up close i can't imagine yeah they're even already spotting him i can't imagine he gets anything and bothers with this round so he'll back off brokey just clearing the close angles it's gonna sit there in case they push that far forward kerrigan's gonna take the opportunity to grab that m good find for him good little upgrade that's probably as well by bits sticking around because he's expecting the bomb to explode and push that gun that direction that's why he's still checking the angles but he's gonna realize right now that that m is long gone yeah joke's on him that ain't there anymore he might go for a little bit of a search yeah he's checking the body someone's already grabbed it little scavengers one to one as faze respond immediately with the rifle by against mostly smgs for navi's defense they're gonna be forced into a low by the two mps that they bring forward imagine you'll see some deagles five sevens ps upgraded pistols pop out on simple perfecto and boom unless simple wants to save for the awp which he does not so - and faze back to god takes out rain with a lovely shot on the deagle oh he's hunting for i was watching that dot on the mini map the whole time just jiggle peeking what a great return on investment that is that'll make you a little bit nervous if your phase all of a sudden to start the round a man down i figured out a way to for faze to win this event or at least make the finals by the way as we've seen them do in several occasions reigns actually standing in for jks this time okay yeah phase with a stand-in is when they're most scary because when they're the scariest crowman exist all the classics it's a good point they have won a lot of events with stanton's bit who misses well kerrigan misses the opportunity sees the jiggle peak pack mentality from faze in this round utility spent on rap side kerrigan's gonna push up with it with the m other three players going to stick around towards lane using the range simple molotov isn't going to spread completely to him hearing it already in front of library looking for an opener he's going to get it electronic down he'll swing as well and see if the rotations will arrive twists gets bit continuing on with a kill around that pace so far brokey takes out simple nice shots and perfect though all that remains that smoke plumed and just ruined brokey's entire plan it looked like he was going to have at least one on towards twist but he lost track of them inside inside the smoke clouds and so simple's opening frag is likely all they're gonna get brokey ready and waiting headshot onto perfecto - phase survive an early disadvantage and still going to be pistols at least for navi we talked about the p and the fact that simple as far as i know the only pro using it um i was going on about magazine size someone sent me a dm and i don't often acknowledge okay here we go you know people that send uh bits of info they think is correct and usually they're wrong but this is a good point the p actually has better movement accuracy than the usp okay that could be part of it it makes him a harder target to hit while he's still running and maybe he has faith in his shots so that could be part of it as well that's got pretty good moving accuracy and a great great bonus money great cash bonus for getting those frags so four kills on rain with the mac  he's up to   but so is rops twist is all the way up at  . money early on for faze is great they've only lost the one player in these two rounds following their second round victory now we get into the rifles still no on the navi side of things light on utility for bit and simple they've got no smokes just a flashbang a piece no head on or a head armor excuse me on a bunch of these players as well keep an eye on that smoke that deep smoke middle we've seen simple get run boosted behind it before we see a lot more teams throwing it so they can get aggressive with utility maybe push down to old middle this man the pace right now from phase as rain gets underneath the atrium picks up a weapon upgrades and tries to hold off but that smoke if they continue to throw at navi's the only team we've seen actually utilize it with the awp they don't have one this round obviously so weren't going to but it is a tell and then we can certainly keep an eye on that this is why i'm so happy that haku actually asked the question about what's it like going up against kerrigan what are your thoughts on it because kerrigan as an in-game leader is just one of those guys who's not ever afraid to go off book to go off script to just kind of call something based on feeling and this is a brilliant time in a round where he knows that they're likely missing some utility go challenge up mid there's not gonna there might not be a smoke there and when they don't see it obviously it's very fortunate now that they made this call happen when navi's trying to set up a boost that absolutely deletes them just to note as well three kills for kerrigan that just won the round he got all three of those entries yeah we spoke about him as well the last matchup they had  frags for kerrigan in the best of three at the end of the group stage in katowice that included a double overtime on the third map and remember him even tweeting out publicly about what a horrible game he felt like he had and obviously there's a little bit of a feeling of wanting to show a better form here quick tech pause coming in tortoise shell glasses a tortoise shell glasses oh my gosh yeah yep the coloring of them and it's you know usually a sign of wisdom and sophistication or henry g would have you so believe i i i get it it it does part that look to me a little bit i mean maybe maybe henry's onto something if the in-game leader is going to be wearing it could be true i don't think i don't think you'd see a star player wearing those those turtle shell glass frames no no no they're going to be waiting oh is the black frame although end game leader as well so all right listen just maybe so all of our theories on in game leader fashion in-game leaders are the only ones allowed that one here we go quick tech pause over four to one all right coach thanks for the tips huddle out and they're off going back and forth much seems no one really decisive in direction off spawn but either way twists already inside the banana position gonna put his own pop flash into play potentially activate him out of that corner no deep utility in terms of molotovs throw in that direction there was a need to treat twist down a  on that nade was it there's two trails was there two nades i only heard one that's the second that one's far he took a lot of damage considering i thought that went to the tree side you gotta know boomish likes to play at the sandbag molotov knight on top of them  hp for boomage flashbang as he jumps up nobody's there twist is going to hear the sound queue as he drops off but booming is going to back away twists will hear that as well so likely calling out the top banana is now clear kerrigan turning the corner looking to challenge has the angle and perfecto's shoulder shows but he gets into safety quickly no real pressure over at the a bomb site just now a bit of utility is thrown out no bodies really coming up mid smoke on rap side molotov towards lane imitating a brackets take brackets control from phase but not utilizing it  seconds on the clock no early picks either side in this particular round that's certainly been something faze has been benefiting from oh i don't know that's the smoke he wanted to throw it hits the stairs but it is going to make things awkward the way that it blooms actually your feet would show first rain's gotten by this electronic can hear it can't do anything with it the team flash though he's lucky he didn't get peaks as electronic sits inside of the site stairs excuse me inside of the pit still inside of the site rather it's fit in the corner and brokey and rain will clear both those positions rob's now in the site itself will cover off as the bomb goes down in the hands of rain actually gonna be turning it back doubling up getting on the board getting rolling as well i said it was rain that was planning it was broken so broke he's gonna actually swing out toward the uh bracket inside the atrium and simple the last alive with the deagle probably not gonna make a play for the round but might try and get an exit and find some guns here he's got those two famas down in lane which i think is broke he's kind of got his eyes on those at the moment the question is simple want to try and deal damage right before the bomb blast broke he's gonna back away at some point we'll push forward into simple he's going to push for it all on his own and he's got simple simple never expected it just one of the famas five to one real quick real early for faze and not just the lead in terms of scoreboard look at the lead in terms of economy all five players from phase before the buy in this round were sitting at k right around there yeah that smoke's a weird one right it looked intentional the way he wanted it to to plume i'm wondering if from his perspective because it lines up weirdly like the circulation of it the the radius of it with the cart and you might see their feet coming through it before they see you because of the height difference it looked like it was misthrowing yeah when i saw his perspective i thought that might actually be quite intentional might have been a bob ross level accident happy little accident hop on simple appearing towards mid i spotted nothing just yet slow-paced banana control booming with the smoke perfecto at the b bomb site has a molotov as well trying to set up the sandbags play again this time a molotov to prevent any escape from boom which flashbang comes out oh that time it's perfectly designed oh the molotov to follow it up as well this attack is split kerrigan sees a gap in the smoke he's going to try and take advantage of it but boom just already gotten away good play from bhumichan perfecto another man advantage for na'vi another one indeed trying to get another round on the board after winning the pistol but being shut out since still if you're of your phase you've kind of counted the utility right you're like okay they just use a molotov they used a smoke as well probably not a whole lot of nades and they'd be correct towards this b bomb site simple still has not budged he doesn't really have anything to slow this down but he does have a pop flash if he was closer by he could bomb it up into the sky by the roof to blind them as they came in but indeed he doesn't kerrigan get a molotov towards booming his position that's massive he's so low go to open and kill from kerrigan they're gonna stream in to the bomb site kerrigan at first orange just goes down perfecto holding on as long as possible symbols here with that flashbang but it's gonna be way too late way too late and reigns got the kill and coming in with the plan so again despite losing the first pick it's gonna be phase that gets inside of the site bit smoke dissipating we'll try and catch them on retreat and removal i don't need to hurry up if they want to go for this at all there's no kits in play i can't imagine i think they're just gonna hold this one out and try and get exits on it i say that though they're still getting a bit more aggressive simple awp looking toward the site itself but the smoke off indicates that they want to use that for their escape yep defensive smoke to back out and save the weapons so navi still not deterred by this five to one now to be six to one lead as soon as the bomb goes off still playing the economic game to make sure they can continue fighting pretty simple t side so far for faze that's not a done this massive lead what's this so yeah true six rounds straight after losing the pistol for faze looking good here on inferno rain eight kills brokey six kerrigan seven twist six so everyone's distribution good the interesting one is that rain's been quietly going about business one name yet to be named in the killing column and that's rhops all good i don't think he cares it's interesting because normally you'd expect him to be right up there but he's only died once as well that's the crazy thing that would have been the pistol round and importantly he's got an mvp star because he planted the bomb ah i guess he has fourteen thousand dollars though zero one and one uh as we hit round eight not bad thanks for showing up props here's your paycheck for being in the server yeah right do i get paid yet gonna be interesting to see when navi starts making the call that they can't go for those kinds of saves when they start feeling the pressure there's that smoke again with the gap on the left side simple blind but doesn't care a couple of speculative shots from the m boomish down inside of the lane he'll go back and retrieve another grenade another smoke from the stockpile yeah he'd set up some deep smokes so showing banana control for the ct side kerrigan and rayne cautiously taking control of brackets just the pair of them rops is still up in holes kerrigan's getting a little peaky he's feeling confident oh that actually forced him back that molotov he thought it might have been a flash i think at first in the air and looked away from it when he did he took a step and if he hadn't i think he gets peaked from a close player in that situation and goes down so bit back to the site instead this is tense it seems like both players wanted to get aggressive towards lane at exactly the same time that's gonna make for an awkward read of what's happening across the map kerrigan's gonna shift smoke out to cover off simple it's not quite it's gonna go oh it does okay i thought it was gonna go into more to the arch when i heard it land but kerrigan will now get access to the arch at the very least does he want to go through this there's no one that's gonna flash his side he is he's gonna go straight through that a second one as well that means he can try and get in through the library with a bit aware of it looking that direction having gone by simple he may have gone undetected that's what he was hoping for robs on the board now he'll get simple down inside of the site twists find bits who only got one more once they arrived once carrick had gone down only one solitary kill coming in and the bomb planted again for faze looking at seven one if perfecto and boomage don't think of this one as an ideal opportunity and they're gonna back away wow what great trading coming in as well that's a good shift in the defense simple gets smoked off gets into the bomb site you have bit hop up on the box to watch for that play through the smoke they got that they neutralize kerrigan as he comes through but everyone else is going down that meant electronic kind of had to be a little bit more spotty a little bit more peaky than he probably wanted to be he didn't i don't think he wanted to be initial contact in that position but the defensive shift forced him into it and simple gets caught i believe looking at lane while the attack came from palace or from halls robs is on the board matt he's got his first kill yep important one as well trade it out simple in the back of the site and allow them to get that bomb plant down much quicker bit was obviously done four in the corner but not finding simple in that back corner could have been very awkward so brocky and robs use the exact same crosshair just to note that's kind of cool who copied who uh i would bet brokey took robson i agree and most of navi's is similar-ish bit simple electronical very similar bringing all the important information here at esl pro league playoffs twist is the only one that's using a dot in the entire server yellow as well ew it's kind of beautiful it's the color of maple syrup it's not actually yellow i was gonna say that's a weird you're having some weird syrup which is odd for canada electronic color of cheese on poutine electronics up with the balcony bit watching rap sides simple has an op again but he's over towards the b bomb site they still have not been able to get a real comfortable read of and set in any kind of way to defend against some of these hits kerrigan's calling a phenomenal game at the moment and they're really leaning on the economic superiority slow playing with some of their utility navi's always struggling to have the right nade at the right time there's that smoke towards left side mid from rops gonna put fit and electronic on notice boomich has gone searching flashbang negates brokies awp simple's rotated off another misread from na'vi confidence in this smoke there's a big gap in that i think booming knows it as well he jumped right into this position to exploit flashes inside of it smokes as well boom just to back away but he puts the incendiary down twists thought about going through it instead he extinguishes it didn't want to be isolated one of his teammates to get in there with him but couldn't find the lineup onto perfecto only hit him with one shot puts him on  and then booming is able to walk out crossfire undeterred so far rob sprays it you get one oh he's got the second as well they fall into his weapon three in total this round awp in hand for him but with only three seconds left the bomb will not be planted and navi will get their second seven to two that's gonna keep this awp they're not gonna push the issue that's a costly victory that looked a little bit sloppy from avi but you can understand the idea they're kind of throwing bodies into that retake before they even begin so that they don't have time to go for the plan so that robs has to waste seconds however that does take the op out of simple's hands for the next round boomich can afford one but does he want to he's got . and he's gonna go for the m simple gonna pick up the noob tube the auto shotgun a new weapon in the simple arsenal let's see what he can do with it go mitch you're standing in flames my friend down to  hp that was from his own situation that he could have pushed through but was expecting him to be more aggressive and without the mully employee didn't want to get that low in the lane he will get twists who came through the smoke thinking it was safe good to see boomish kind of exert his will though at banana in this round to just really dominate put down twists and just say i have banana control this round you have no access to it challenging for it navi looking for their second in a row towards bit and simple they're extremely perfecto towards spawn bits gonna find a kill right through the smoke that's from library bombs dropped reign has to get aggressive to pick it up free firing into the smoke trying to keep these defenders at bay oh almost found bit there it's lucky to be alive through that smoke three on five looks like navi have stabilized simple with that auto shotgun still has not been put into play just i know twist has cooled off a little bit he was at six kills i think four rounds in he's only on seven now and in the last round couldn't quite get that lineup under perfecto that might have made the difference in the round as well so it's very easy to go cold when you know even though you're winning the rounds and things are going your way if you're not able to get anything and then suddenly you're put on the spot rops has certainly recovered from a slow start but again as you mentioned you wouldn't have been upset by that was not dying it wasn't like he was struggling he just wasn't needed he might be now as he's gonna come out from the apartment position smoke already on the corner shotgun dink simple down below is going to get two and bomb will fall to his feet brokey up close can't do anything with the awp good old shotgun action heads up play from simple really well done just watching the other side of that smoke and you would have seen that here he would have seen that if he was watching tape watching film because remember the last time we saw faze play inferno they recovered from a lot of awkward situations with robsters lurking out of those halls along that balcony he was able to find plenty of openings to bring the round back in phases favor so simple steps up the alligator goes to work he's got the op now as well picks it up off broke his head cold dead hands again keep an eye on that smoke he didn't even go that direction he's over toward banana right now so no need to get aggressive for boomage but nate karen going to twist that off down already boomers has to grab it and run back with it so he's already rotating around oh that's so much counter utility having to be spent to slow down any kind of hit that might be coming they had no idea they had to dump a bunch twist is actually in a pretty decent position if he wanted to peek in but with the man advantage again a great call from kerrigan or whoever calls for the triple aid in towards that position after simple picks up the op look how little utility was thrown as well because simple wants them to come that direction he thinks he can take that fight kerrigan's going to just nail bit i admire boomich not only did he immediately identify that he has to pick up the awp but he rotates around like an opera should do to stay dynamic unfortunately for him perfecto is the only one left in b and this round's over rops is still lurking toward the apartments as well he's spotted up though and a little bit of damage into him but he can certainly take weapons away and he'll do exactly that to electronic it's going to be eight to three for faze simple mentioned that this game was going to come down to kind of i think his words were whoever does more damage is likely going to take it and certainly mention the individual level of players as being a main factor in this due to the individual capabilities of these phase players at the moment they are destroying navi on an individual level you add on top of that kerrigan's calling in this game the fast pace in the first gun round up mid that catches navi off guard the triple nade that eliminates simple he gets caught off guard by that in this round towards the b bomb site so they're getting beat individually they're getting beat tactically as well and that's why faze is sitting at a five-round lead eight to three still plenty of money navi have not dug into this extra cash in the pockets of phase whatsoever in the rounds phase have won they have never dropped below three players surviving these wins these round wins for faze have been so convincing electronic with a deep nade hoping to do damage at the bottom of the middle with tickle twists brokey trying to get aggressive with the aw yikes yeah smoke off twists that's fine hey twists you've had enough kills okay i need to get my op going seven kills for brokey eight for twists plenty of nades and molotov spent still no rotation from the eight offenders simple still perched watching mid four smokes in a molotov plenty of flashbangs for faze for the rest of this round there's a decent amount of utility as well nami's done a good job of holding on to their molotovs phase look like they're going to take mid control brackets control we've seen them do this a number of times sometimes they've used it sometimes they haven't that's good counter utility counter smoke from simple they're going to come through it simple as the first kerrigan doesn't want to let him get away simple knows this and bit's going to peek into the flames to help protect the upper and back to the b bomb side we go but this hit has to begin right now twists a couple of quick shots again inside smoke he's gonna be the one to enter he's got coverage on his right side at coffins no one would be above that he's already gotten into water so they won't be able to peek him from there but a flash out he's able to detect an evade and a cap through looking for perfecto but he comes into a crossfire they peek it together they use sound perfectly and perfect though and boom and shut out the sight eight to four oh that's got to be a great feeling for na'vi finally finally they survived with all five players a very clean win and this time they were able to as i mentioned hold on to their utility you can see the impact it had the smoke towards the b bomb site that slows things down doesn't let them know perfecto's position twists had to be very very cautious and considerate of where the peak was going to come from a follow-up flashbang from boomich over the top as well just very nicely played from boomer in perfecto at b as well as simple and bit over towards brackets oh simple's going to use it this time they've been setting this up throughout the half broke he's ready for it never caught snoozing and i mean part of that whole booming just blind as well oh no kerrigan countering everything bit gonna find the kill bring it back to a v but there's only one defender at a that's electronic rotating back though bit's going to try and get there perfecto with them one through arch one through library no one in the pit side but no one pushing out yet from faze either an electronic gonna go all the way around knowing that if they don't have the pit position he can still get aggressive still trying to cut this off using the atrium set up a crossfire as well with bit but he's smoked off shoulder shows that's gonna be enough rain knowing he fired into it knowing he was down the lane capitalizes he's trying to find a head shot he had the lineups already had the positions right they just wouldn't give it to him robs has to tear it from them instead his perfecto holding inside of the side is both defined and rob steps up to take him down as well tough situation electronic might be a little bit frustrated as he's playing up in lane he's got two teammates back in the bomb site not either of them are watching holes well enough to prevent them from wrapping and dropping behind him as he's trying to hold on to boilers he's trying to fight over the flames in middle it's completely caught great opening though from phase so hard to recover these three vs even when you rotate everyone in the right position and perfecto you can't blame him he had to try and find a v while his molotov was still burning ninth round for faze two remaining in the half na'vi trying to keep this as close as possible trying to withstand this beastly performance on the t side a down twist tag to  again he's been playing in that pocket that made a little more direct and it's the big bad boom the sonic boom he's got to go against rain meanwhile trying to find access toward the top of middle nose there's still a smoke down he'll get mid wall at the very least i know been waxing lyrical about kerrigan's calling this game but another change of pace and navi had to dump a decent amount of utility early just because it's happened so many times the phase has gone from fast to slow back to fast again a number of times throughout this in different parts of the map so this defense can't ever really get a read and look at the gap look at the opening that's been found rain ballsy and courageous but he's found a huge positional advantage simple slowly working back this direction is aware that arch could be given up but he's not aware that rayne is inside of the library down he goes smartly one step ahead and as he turns around bits found as well electronic through the smoke twist has the kill onto him he'll plant the bomb safely in the corner they have library side so no need to leave it open to the atrium and on the hunt already kerrigan down to the bottom side of banana they don't have a lot of money left over on navi these two weapons are all they're going to have to work at the end of the half we're going into round . and if you're faze you send everything at the hunt you're gonna leave twist just to watch and make sure there's no sneaky defuse right at the end reign has already spotted perfecto but faze want to take everything away and i think they're going to do it boomich the main chokepoint gonna get an off angle kill perfect trade from rob's perfect flashbang from rain and great precision from rops on the blind player ten to four double digits for faze knobby coming in this looking a little lethargic they haven't been able to stop anything they haven't really been able to slow phase down even rounds in which they've found some opening kills faze has done a phenomenal job of recovering in them absolutely yeah you're right when you go back to i mean you've seen push get that opening kill one or two more as well i was gonna say they lost the opening pistol right and then obviously echoed it right back two rounds later they lost the man advantage they pulled that back with an execution on b to make it a three-three from a five on three and yeah they've you're right it's not like they've needed the opening pick they've just been very coordinated on how they're going to take the map from na'vi kind of super difficult ct half for navi and it's going to stay that way they have not gotten comfortable not really once final round of the first half navi likely can't be more thankful that this is almost coming to an end if they can switch sides bit gonna swing out dropped electronic with the kill but oh how many more can he get kerrigan's very low he's found that staying alive in the pit he's got aks up against him simple has pushed through the smoke as well smoke at the front of the bomb site but they're not rapping just yet through this smoke it's gonna be simple with the kill twist finds electronic twist does find electronic symbols not done above the smoke still trying to get the job completed and have they cleared the pit they have so perfect though and simple the only two left drops over top of the smoke and perfecto rotating around i'm not much for skins but i will say that that mp electronic was holding the pit is the best skin i have seen in all of counter-strike is perfect though might not have any skin left on his body at the end of this round because phase are gonna steal it from him nice shot to catch out twists the headshot he's still got a chance in this he's got a kit keep that in mind and now he has a chance to go and grab twists okay he's got the awp i was just a twist weapon but perfecto onto the off instead knows he just needs one shot can't find it that would have been the opportunity tons of time left on the clock and now knowing that the awp is in play perfecto has to find rops who's hiding behind a wall he's looking for some luck he's looking for the wall bang trying to bait him out and he's going to go aggressively he's hit it he's got time he absolutely does he's got a kit that's a huge huge fight to win yeah that's brilliant what a clutch from perfecto and rob's played that pretty well also perfecto had to go hunt that down and they've got five a little bit of a smile on blade's face one of the few he probably had throughout that half stressful stressful half for navi phenomenal for faze we'll see how it's going to go in the second half stay tuned he's come back over time with an amazing play from robs in the finals against g academy so this time it opens the series and they've opened it very well phase - on their t-side against na'vi who bookended the round they won the pistol with an incredible shot from electronic and then a nice clutch from perfecto to win the final round but only five in total it was pretty few and far between yeah i mean incredible shots though bringing them two two rounds and outside of that faze worked them they figured him out and they were just pulling navi all across the map they could not get situated on the defensive side down five rounds heading into the pistol round navi's gonna play this one passively to begin plenty of players back towards base of mid as bit establishes some control in banana or at least some safety there's your boy randy's back on the pk uk yeah there you go there's another one got a navi sticker on that bad boy it's just like yo i'm gonna take simple's gun maybe it's the navi killer maybe he only uses it in these matches against na'vi okay so that he can style on them yes just rub it in give the give the sticker a little kiss at the end of each round simple p is trying to make some noise toward kerrigan a couple shots that force him back off the angle doesn't want to repeat meanwhile electronic with a glock searching out information on the opposing side of the map yeah the hit's going to come in right now because electronics in position to pick and choose when he wants to lurk rain's going to try and block that smoke as best he can he's going to step through it now electronic oh dear gets absolutely wrecked by brokie who is ready for that play four on five three on five simple goes down that's the p hit in the deck rain gets goosed and dropped through smoke kerrigan's gonna come through with the flashbang kerrigan's already beginning this oh he's gonna stop the plaque bomb hits ground no one from navi protecting it good return from bit but that might be a dagger that's a huge play look at the flank as well rops can do it all over again p by the way was the one that killed simple so it didn't work out for ring quite literally he's not gonna stop the plant at this time they still get it down but they've got positioning as you say rops already on the back door will take down bit broke he found the kill on perfecto as that happened so faze will get this pistol around and go - just that delay caused by kerrigan taking down the initial bomb planter puts rops in a perfect position he could have even hustled and challenged leia plant a little bit more he had so many options good heads up play from brokey as he rotates off not taking his attention away from the corner faze have a six round lead and as has been the theme economic control two m has picked up famas on twist they know a buy of some sort is gonna come in it's gonna be a hero ak- over on simple boomage drops that over now would be a great time for simple to provide something special nobody from navi and double digits just yet nine kills on perfecto and bit eight on boomag seven on simple five on electronic meanwhile all five players of phase in double digits so zimbabwe was right this match is coming down to the individual performances unfortunately the best individual performances at the moment are all on the face side whoever does the most damage will win is what he said and unfortunately that's not always true but in this case very much so so um maybe he's a bit of a savant a bit of a prophet see if he can profit in this round he's got an ak a hero weapon kerrigan on the off side let's push down already a nice steep and send the area that'll hold them out a little bit longer as well a minute still to work with smoke on top of it a little bit late didn't quite extinguish immediately so there's a bit of a time period in which it blooms and that's when they jump through but that's when kerrigan standing there at the ready will take them down at least the first one pretty decent damage on the simple down to  hp he's gonna transition over towards mid there's a three player stack here one up on the balcony one underneath and one left side mid and there's not enough utility to negate this only one flashbang and there is no way simple even looked up towards the balcony didn't see anyone rob slides out a little bit further is able to get one cheeky kill bit brought down and broke he's going to hunt him down there's electronic bouncing but too little too late although he does have a famous in hand ready perfecto and ak coming to play two rifles three on two winnable situation he's blinded but no one spots him no armor yet electronic down below though this is kerrigan that's easily should be taken down given the hp situation but you're right no armor and as he backs off kerrigan baiting with noise he gets caught up by brokey and they can't actually collect kerrigan that running mp too quick yeah the drive-by you sing bolt well done ak- picked up and salvaged for kerrigan who gets a double kill brokey with two kills as well faze with a commanding seven round lead but another buy gonna be coming in for na'vi that plant helps out massively and also they only spent money on one ak- so boom which will go down to something like a tech nine maybe a deagle he liked the p in the first half everyone else gonna have the ak-s navi running out of time to get back into this game running out of time to start a comeback definitely are and navi's had quite a bit of time off obviously played and won the group - got the bye to the quarter-final had quite a bit of time off since that group d included uh what was it last sunday so perfecto swinging through trying to find some damage inside the smoke didn't quite jump all the way to the bags but couldn't walk it over them but that's exactly what kerrigan's ready for and rain swinging and only good for one the trades come back robson rain down bit simpler kills but still a man to the good on the face side god that's the kind of really really stiff resistance that we never saw navi try and pull off at the top of banana in the first half at most it was boomish being set up with flashbangs and molotov by perfecto really not a whole lot of bodies moving out towards sandbags for the ct side when navi was playing defense simple and bit with the smoke gonna block off twist gonna find an avenue into the bomb site no one's home brokey rotating over through library he'll be joined up likely with twists kerrigan flanking up middle but the bomb is gonna get planted and we have a retake scenario simple getting away from the molotov doesn't want to burn alive while putting that down only on  hp it'll buy a bit of space to set this retake up as they're gonna get closer it's all on kerrigan's flanking halls if he finds bit over in graveyard that's everything it's tough angle tough ask a few different headshot positions he could peek from and he just holds the bottom of the stairs they're gonna try and boost above smoke twists drops down noise made and given that it's a falling noise you may even expect that there's two there because where do we fall from has fallen into the grave at this point in good hold as bit pops out to get twists nice cross fire between hand simple yeah that graveyard position is just so so so strong especially someone like bit with his head shot percentage finds kerrigan as he crosses over kerrigan kind of it looked like he didn't even really necessarily want the peak or maybe was taking a wider peak than that position wanted the information of where bit was but he doesn't get away with it spammed through the door phase finally going to be in some monetary troubles that's a new experience for them in this game it's taken  rounds to get here they do have an open brokey's hands quietly become one of the most impactful offers we have in the scene molotov made chuck it all flash perfect though forced back inside of the corner silenced them for or not simple knows his angles and he absolutely nails him back through the smoke oh he even spotted rops on the balcony this is the first time in the entire game including after winning the pistol that navi has had the economic advantage by the way even in that second round of the first half they had four smgs against like three rifles as well so odd yeah it's been such it has to have been such a frustrating game if you're navi you feel like you haven't really had a whole lot of chances well you've had chances but you feel like you haven't really had enough clean buys to feel comfortable to get back into this game electronics going to start challenging towards rap side broke he's watching this with the op though electro if electronic is the first contact he's likely going down this is just a walk into the awp oh the timing on that is everything he still gets the kill and twist gets one through smoke this is a doable retake they're gonna come for this kerrigan's on the flank up banana he's only got a p m on twist eagle on rops up and broke his hands as well shot out from bit we'll take down kerrigan i wonder if they're gonna commit now that they've lost that player looks like they just want to back off and survive the bomb blast simple wants to take the weapons away he's going to push forward bits even got them locked in there's the first i played from broke he wouldn't expect that angle would you perfecto knows he can't stay around any longer to take him down and brokey sacrifices himself the problem is he sacrifices the awp five five-round lead navi's starting to cut into it navigate not going out without a fight seemed like they might just fade away after the first half and losing the pistol round but this is great to see yeah just stepping into it finds the head shot through smoke rain goes down uh twist not entirely through smoke he did spot boomitch before it plumed round . i don't think we've seen a timeout from either of these teams just yet navi played through a lot of adversity in the first half kerrigan obviously was just feeling the call so much no need electronic wants to be first around the corner this time this is where that shot went through the smoke in the last round the nade trajectory suggests someone else is in that position rops removes simple with perfection now he's gonna fall off of it and when they go hunting twist is able to back him up electronic falls next meanwhile back over at b boom it's trying to distract and hold the two players inside of the site at bay because bit is working out look at this one two punch yeah fair play from bit i don't even mind that play he thought he had one he knew he had to thin it out he could have never expected the second player was going to be there so it takes a big risk and obviously doesn't work out for him but navi was running out of options he had to see if he could catch them before they're able to fall back in towards safety to punish the retreat from lane factor needs to look up he's to look up but he's got smoke in his face faze have found some solutions in a very low buy scenario three players here as rops is watching in mid obvious hoping their silence would force someone to rotate away twist is even all the way back by t apartments just to make sure they can't save these weapons and navi's starting to back off now twist might have a role yet to play twist's gonna sneak it around kerrigan perfecto couldn't land it on the ak slow to find it that's twice kerrigan's just been running and gunning on that mp oh boomage slips the net at least for the moment they're hunting he can get away from underpass gonna stick in it turns around they're gonna drop to find this and kerrigan gets him right at the end good sacrifice from twists looks like they could smell them  to  for the rat and the sewers nobody likes a rat especially not a tarkov player snakes a good point maui likes rats confirmed time out taken blade trying to get a little bit of life and energy one last adjustment perhaps i think with this kind of a deficit you have to at least put an ak- on bit he's got  throw that hero ak- on his back see if he can provide you anything i'll be running out of options and running out of time round  faze looking to take a - lead in this series on their map pick obviously come in with a phenomenal game plan been very effective absolutely has back to the pistols this time kerrigan gonna get aggressive taking that unicorn pride all the way to the bottom baby he's gonna try and run a gun and spray some more just absolutely removing perfecto with such gusto no remorse as he continues to run and hold that position he's gonna come back and help rocky hey man my ak is insufficient do you think maybe you can just bring that little nail gun back if that's all right this is phase just flexing oh so hard everywhere on the map they're pushing forward that's a good kill as he spins to find kerrigan at the door that's all he's gonna get though you're not wrong they're not even giving an inch they're just absolutely saying oh navi you think you're good huh up and you're up in their face not letting navi have anything it's one way to mess with the confidence mess with the best team in the world just don't let don't let them breathe you can very quickly go the other way but you'd expect karen going to be ready for that too and be able to react and adapt but this is yeah no full gas right now from phase another timeout taken from navi to talk over this incoming gun round again going to be a little bit sparse on the buy a few players really struggling simple force bought the armored eagle in the last round he's gonna buy deal armor again here so no rifle on him let's push down banana there's push in halls there's obviously a push down mid and attention towards ultimate live out of the timeout quarterfinals of esl pro league furio waiting for the winner kerrigan perfectly pushing again he's only good for one but rain is right there and he finds two not only did he get electronic he got simple in that exchange one through the smoke and one to the left that's broke he has to back away rob's gonna hold inside of the boiler it's just bit and boomish and faze looking to try and find map points already yeah on inferno just constant aggression navi never able to even execute any plans to recover the bomb fazel let him have it they don't care they've got robson boiler brokey off angle and brackets rain and twists both playing in the spawn choke point all they need is one and then they can play as passively as they'd like and wait for reinforcements for the retake they don't even necessarily need the one they don't have to commit to find it fit trying to get inside of the site smokes off the molotov because he was lit a blaze gap inside of those two smokes and twist makes no mistake to take his head clean off boomish that will fall suffer the same fate and fall in the same position as he walks in reign with the kill and it is indeed map point for phase  to seven navi only in single digits still and they've looked very strong in pro league there's no question about it faze looking excellent today yeah we were just commenting last night that it was it was good to see navi uh after uh obviously the the katowice performance uh from navi uh coming into this group stage looking revitalized looking like they had a chance to kind of you know get their mind off things and take a break and come back in solid form yeah i even took a bit of a break between the group and and now we're going to amsterdam oh that's a fun afternoon yeah okay well face have eight chances to close this out they've looked so good but let's not let's let's not extend this if you're just watching at home if you're a phase fan don't get too excited you know navi's going to recover between maps absolutely you're a navi fan don't get too worried well dust  is next as well which is yeah i mean it's it's a map you can quickly recover on it's not like there's anything crazy it's another heads up dual map though in a lot of ways it's individual duels for positions and right now as you said jason it's been all the individual prowess of phase winning out but boom which this time is going to get the opening pick burning a player alive in the form of kerrigan considering they're on pistols again to try and force this game longer that's a great opening kill to find simple's had deagle armor for the last three rounds he hasn't been able to get a rifle in his hands i mean we always talk about economy is easier to manage when you're on the t side but this has been uh this has been a game where navi just haven't been able to get anything going in their favor they've constantly been on the back foot in terms of their money and then you add in the tactics and the individual level and that's why you have such a huge gap in the scoreboard five on four for navi that they desperately need to win but blind is electronic booming with an important trait twist steps through couple nice kills for him you can see it coming twists wanted to go through the smoke on his own he was flashed as soon as his teammate engaged he absolutely knew he had to jump on them in for two and it's down to just simple and perfect but hang on b's wide open brokey's going back now but he's already smoked off they're gonna get a bomb plant out of this at the very least and a bomb plant down simple on a deagle this could still become interesting they're not even certain they're probably somewhat confused how do we get the whole site to ourselves well  seconds left in the round they do and they've got an m picked up simple is a little bit more than a deagle now you mentioned it as well he has armor reigns gonna start to clear and sneak it behind for the peek out from coffins now they know where simple is he's gonna get a double on that as well twists falls they gave this one away brokey not with his customary sneaking to try and find an angle instead goes to the knife to walk just that extra bit faster because he wants to stay quiet and undetected but as he gets closer simple looms large on the back side of the connecting position he's fallen low hp but broke his tagged as well single digit for both in time is now very much the enemy and they have to run it away perfecto gets the kill on the tec- and he will survive to carry an ak back into the round i actually thought that faze was going to do a great job of just wrapping all the way around that kind of stack on coffins i thought coming up would be the perfect play but obviously they just never had the information of where the second player was they only ever saw simple he's the one who got the kills made that very diff here difficult to figure it out you could even see twist coming in for the retake looking elsewhere you can see in that clip as he's looking back towards new boxes hoping for the follow-up peak from the second player that just never came seven rounds left for faze to find the final round to close out the first map take a - lead going into dust two perfecto pushing up molotov can be put out he's on his own easy kill for kerrigan simple does step through oh he's on a rampage he's got kerrigan stuck in the corner and he's gonna find that for sure relentless in trying to create something in a desperate situation  kills you're right he's definitely motivated now wants to try and bring this back level all on his own it seems broke he's the only one in the server oh take it back excuse me kerrigan's got . he's looking excellent electronic by the way two in the opening pistol one of them was absolutely stunning he has six kills total where has he been all game simple i'll tell you where he is right now pushing ct spawn behind his smoke wants to run these guns down wants to firmly give navi the advantage and keep faze forever away from that th point want to give electronic a little bit of a a little bit of caster support when playing that pit position kerrigan worked him so much or on the map it felt like you know even when they went b the hits were so convincing that electronic didn't really have a chance to get involved in the action when they came a the trading was so good electronic was always in really difficult fights brokey challenging to take some guns away right at the end and he's got two simple pushing forward op is important to keep in brokey's hands and simple will not move around the corner  to   more chances for faze they're on the weapons again this time given that they were able to save still not in a comfortable situation but and i shot a boomich by brokie navi fans rejoice not out of this yet by any means here it is the run boost for brokey though not for simple it's not the fling the middle but it is to try and get an early access to that stairwell a little bit too late though just barely a little bit too late this can be interesting if if nabi's able to win this one finally they take the money away from face electronic is going to go down good peek from twist again faze challenging all the choke points when attention is at the b bomb site they're flash peeking towards mid when attention on mid they're throwing bodies out towards sandbags at the b bomb site faze having a very aggressive and dynamic defense brokey now rotating over he's found boomich out in the open five on three for faze a phenomenal chance to close out this map right here right now and shut this comeback down bit pulling it ever so slightly closer and back toward na'vi though as he gets rops and some map control he'll head to the front of the library from there he's got to worry about parochial rotation but it's really only twists that holds the a site again a bit of an over rotation and caught out his perhaps phase even getting desperate to fire in through the smoke they know now where the awp is twist scone that is the sight simple was found through smoke what a great grab from brokey fortunate grab from brokey  seconds left in the clock molotov gonna be put out inside the bomb site plant will not be delayed bit trying to cover trying to look over the top retake's gonna come from lane i think he saw him in library as well so i think he's gonna expect that they're gonna give that up give given that he didn't peek after it there's no further utility kerrigan's down below though bit needs to be spot on with when he peaks and that bomb's so far in the corner if they're able to get him fast enough get the fence down quick enough there's no way can do anything other than try and peek it out but the crossfire is too strong broke he left in a one-on-two and he's not gonna go for it he's just gonna try and do damage at this point in time get his own awp and run oh that's a three versus five one by navi again you mentioned it as well the over rotation leaving twists all alone the pick from simple was absolutely magnificent that's a frustrating way to go down with your twists how about chickens yeah teleported out he was see he came right back changed keller somehow but he was a fine he's fine magic bomb it's a paint bomb  to . and no more money for phase all they have is this awp and brokey's hands now they have some losing bonus built up they've got three rounds of it so they can invest in a small light armor with some upgraded pistols they can challenge for this round in a couple different ways bring some tools to bear that's a great pick as kerrigan fuller is actually coming in for the retake excuse me and then just a phenomenal job from perfecto inside the bomb site staying alive grabbing that one player roki the run boost again deep mid sawn elbow but didn't get a clean shot so rain forced back inside of the site faze giving away a few too many rounds the last time these two teams did play in an esl event in particular was katowice not in the playoffs as i mentioned at the start of the show however start of the series as you said however they did play in the groups to determine who would get the by to the semifinals very similar score line on mirage and faze was unable to close that out navi came back i think eight rounds in a row took that to overtime and then won the game i messaged kerrigan after and said man oh man just keep your head up you guys are gonna be fine because he looked absolutely devastated by it and then they of course went on to win the event he'll have that in the back of his mind they can't give this away to nabi again likewise navi's gonna be thinking hey we've done this before let's keep going full gas well kerrigan had  kills in that series as we referenced previously he's got  in this map alone so far so i guarantee that was in his mind as he prepared and warmed up today that's probably been his full focus on recovering and have a better showing here today individually it's there the calling in the first half was there as well twist spots one but the other two are so close he never had a real chance piroque going to line up with the off and the molotov steps into it oh a double that's unreal they've got a shot they've got a chance now on the low on hp two in the flames that's silly the fact that he sticks that out he goes just for one and gets a double version efforts that's huge he's still in this with the awp  hp bits on . this is suddenly a winnable situation by the most audacious and full play in the world but he's not ready for bit to be that far forward he did pull the gun out but not quite enough as robs knows he's low we'll try and swing around behind him there's ample opportunity to win the round if he finds him quick enough what pit's going to evade and i think that's going to be it there's no way rops can win it now rops his goal is to get that up and the tough part is bit can't really protect it he has no hp he is going to have to bail out far away from the bomb site in towards boiler he's going to discover the location of rob simple going to come in next drops wants to get that awp not going to have the opportunity and simple just lets it lie keeps with the ak- na'vi just four rounds back it's been four straight for them faze running out of chances to close the map as we as we talk about yeah this is great it's the only real chance they had to win in the round and that's one of the things that's made brokey such an exciting opera as well he's willing to take those massive massive risks i was going to say we're talking about katowice let's go back to it because faze has been in this situation before albeit from the other side of things they had the massive comeback on g in the grand finals yeah that is true they have proven that they also can come back the point is they know it both teams know it's possible and both teams need to play accordingly right now because faze cannot afford to give this away this one's for elimination and remember they just dropped a five on three just a few rounds back and they did it by over rotating again we saw that in the three on three as well when they went toward b and simple picks up the m they're just getting a little bit ahead of themselves good find from robs this time as he gets bit down in the apartments good damage as well on perfecto and boomage but kerrigan and rain are gonna have to be very sharp right now over at the b side of the map yeah when does twist choose to start cheating over and rotate it doesn't have any nades for support nothing in his pocket rain is boosted up kerrigan holding the molotov he's gonna hear the footsteps molotov coming out there's no smoke to extinguish it that's gonna split it that means there's only one player running through and it's simple he gets dropped by rain up above now it's desperate now it's near impossible another molotov reigns in that's from brokey  seconds of the clock navia the time if they want to run back and consider the other bomb site but at least for now boomich is going to see what he can find smoke clears towards spawn but they can't do anything about it brain does at least get the trade discouraging sneaking out from the backside that's gonna be broken back into the same position that just cleared and they thought they had it clear the whole time great setup and a great win from phase it took them a bit at the end it gave naughty some room and we know that that can be enough certainly for them to come back onto dusk too looking strong but phase win as we said what could have been the pivotal half in the series yeah such an impressive win great win from faze and that means they get to talk to heku
