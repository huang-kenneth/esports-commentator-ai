oh yes sir thank you gentlemen that's jason and maniac we are ready to kick off navi versus faze starting off with inferno this is a semi final only one of these teams stay alive at the end of it and they will be going on to that grand final it's machine and sponge take it away guys oh we will we're getting straight into it inferno starting as a first as opposed to a third but i'm into it and so is simple straight to the apps for info and upon second glance mid he'll get a more rude awakening four members of phase barraging down middle it looks like they might commit chad i'm seeing you till in the air boom it's rocking some dooley's unable to contest and they're gonna have to let them in straight through short three are up simple's gonna be behind late on that apps i'm not sure he's gonna account for that he's coming yeah he's coming and stalking fires off a warning shot but it's silenced i think they've worked it out now and a good shot across the bow the struggle with the julie's as well into the site looking great for phase the bodies line up brokie immediately contributes with him a nice double and his stats on inferno yesterday chad blew my mind he didn't have a single death  frags and that's just in the rounds one yeah that was men hang on there's some cash to be uh found here  in the bank account carrick will take that and that is a flawless pistol round starting phase right on the best foot yeah that's a fantastic way that's going to do a lot for the confidence out of the gates early the fact carrigan slipped into the back lines there with the knife killed the round was already secured so a bit more salt in the wound and it was looking good for a moment there for navi as this is all going in there chasing down electronic he did his job perfectly but simple behind the usp in the back we talk about it time and time again never easy to convert fluffs his lines early and what could have been a defense of that a site quickly falls apart we get underway here and it will be that navi  spike but now you've had six days off god that does feel that sounds like a lot doesn't it yeah so uh a lot of time for them to just sit and wait and then the debate will be will be whether you would rather have six days to rest and prep or be super hot off your quarter final that's the thing as well right you have to look at this whole scenario for navi did they really think they were going to burst phase how much prep did the likes of uh boomidge and blade do together for phase and how much can you even look at the demos yeah there's lots of this event but this is them in peak form it's not like this is every day of the week phase yeah i mean i guess if we're gonna theorycraft in that respect no don't forget how many na'vi gambit head-to-heads we had during the rmr i mean i'm sure their prep folder for gambit was pretty stacked as it stood maybe faze did get the fair share of the homework it's not like you can necessarily the way carrigan's been calling his t-sides it's a lot based on just an entire squad buying into his call and it's a lot of impulsive and spontaneous decision making smoke exchange will they respect it i think they're through yeah rain leaping across alongside before the ride is all off the bombs on their back and we will see the sight taken rotates on its way the entire navi squad pulls up their socks and starts to jog to the other side perfecto's right now they can smoke off banana and they can flash to go on in but there's no defuse kit for this so navi are going to have to put this together quickly yeah and it's going to be coming through off the back of that util charging and cough inside couple of wall banks from simple do go awry more where that came from these flashes could suppress it's about this next moment they're pushing in rain holds them at bay nicely controlling the spray carrigan still has an ak in play rain doing everything he can to delay over halfway tick now yeah and now more bodies starting to hit the deck electronics down olaf brings a fight to simple he greets him with the deeg looks like that smoke implies they just want to try and escape at this point everybody's got this i think they'll get all three away so that's not too bad maybe some weapons can be retrieved after time yeah perfecto's trying to hang out closer to the site that picks something up but he even grabs himself that galil so all right that's not too bad in those situations when the bomb site's given up we're traditionally going okay well they're just going to hold on to their goodies but now we opted to try and keep things expensive and well it kind of worked out it's not the best it's not the worst phase get their second and we will see those deagles carried across a p thrown to electronic can ask a stupid question did they plant in that pistol was it did the carrigan knife them before they planted i couldn't tell you either way i was just thinking that's probably the most money you could possibly have uh coming into this third round you've not only got knife kills you've got double bond plant and boomich have a little look and good night carrigan tucked in tight by the leader of navi this gets dangerous now as long as simple doesn't go down here oh lord there are very very few players that will get away with peaks like that simple already knocks reigns straight out and two bodies already down smokes are flying electronics here with the smoke of his own he could throw this one down and force him through the gray screen but that's boom eliminated the b bomb site is open now don't forget perfecto saved himself that galil he'll be bringing that to the party late bit yet to find his first frag and here's his chance a great chance that he's his aim twist too quick using that ak to great success so some opening kills did put na'vi into that very brief three versus five it's been equalized and then some with the bomb now ticking we need to get a move on here if they do want to win this round bomb almost halfway tick now simple coming up banana electronic through coffins no nades it's gonna have to be brute force i say that electronic does have a smoke he's gonna try and get that on towards the bottom it will create a little bit of pressure brokey relieves all the pressure he's going hunting simple will punish that and finding even more it doesn't have the time but he's made this so costly jesus olaf desperately trying to hold on to his ak and just about gets away with that still kept very very honest into the third yeah good damage there from navi again now obviously we're talking about the bombs going down the knife kill from carrigan i don't think money is too much of a problem here and you can see that reflected in the buy broke you straight into that t-sided awp and when we saw that yesterday that was the most impressive thing that it was you know him finding impact with the t-side at all now that's not easy to do nor is this bang the one bullet followed up by simple both of them stylish to start off round number three but mopped up and saved there from brokey the interview for brokey as well was just a great little portal into his character he was finished for a second there yeah we know a couple of soft spoken latvians though that's very true oh now that's not quite worked out well for electron you can see him just rolling his eyes as it's not achieved the goal he had in mind simple bringing out that ct all for the first time yeah that's still gonna do the same job it's a bit scuffed but nobody from phase here are going to be tempting their luck up through middle simple gonna peek out with the awp and he strikes i'll lock down an opening for rv now the openings in the last round but they're still lost so can they convert now the rifles are out lots of pressure on perfecto now we saw him a glimpse of kerrigan now smoke regardless let's force the rotate out of simple don't forget this is a heavy disadvantage fourth phase they've still parked rain over towards app so it's a technically a v if there is a commitment fully flash confirms it's still presence there and simple's going to be posted up here kerrigan's just ahead of that scope simple doesn't miss quick to the trigger and kerrigan pushed on up completely on his own will be hunted down boom which finds him seems to be aware that there's a walk-up from rain quite persistent in his app's presence and bits just playing in that safe haven of sight chance oh and it's a big one if they could just find bit there's a world they can get that bomb down newest addition filling the shoes of flaming has so far done a bang-up job brokey however has been a star in the making four-phase clan bomb to go down one versus three navi will treat him with respect grouping up and he's taking some liberties here take your time simple slaps him down another multi-kill round out of the superstar seven now for simple seven kills four rounds of play things looking good staying on track for that superstar form that we have seen and that defuse will come on through i love what the death said about simple you know i think the best way to to frame it is he's just competing against himself now yeah i'm sure zai we may have done something for him you know that may have ignited a fire in his belly but i think it's entirely just that that perfect championship mindset where you just want to be better than your previous self i love the conversation right and i'm glad that there is a contender too simple in xy with but for me with all the counter counter-strike that i've watched this man right here he's just magic he's just something else he's a completely different piece there's a lot of great counter-strike players but i don't think there's anybody who does it just quite like simple navi they're out the gates they've got themselves around and they've even humbled that economy now the flow on effects from those first two anti-eco rounds right the deagle kills simple with the galil getting a lot of frags that's forced them already straight down towards pistols so you can see the ramifications and here he is again oh he's fired off a warning shot he runs him down that is lovely oh they partner up broke he does put some bullets down and kerrigan leading from by example he's managed to bait the shots pushing pressure now on short this is a bit of a gamble here if they can force electronic down swinging in nice fine from olive if they get him as well faze have got the sight they may not have a chance to get the bomb down that's a perfect nade  hp combined here oh dear double nade that ends their dreams there was molly to follow they did get the plant at least yeah well they've managed that uh i think every single round right now they've been getting that bomb down keeping that economy flowing that's going to help them out with the buy but that was a sketchy round right around that i'm talking about yeah the ramifications navi have done a good job of grinding the economy down they should get an easy one next minute simple dies the pressure's on a they're going one for one at best and that almost fell apart perfecto looks like he's been testing that arm yeah this is the double kill nade perfect little lineup for your matchmaking games bang and the dirt is gone i need to stop referencing adverts from the s they're good adverts barry scott here i've waited to get into slap chop maybe that'll resonate with our viewer base a little bit more oh that looks good what are you eating over there either way i'm hoping you're staying hydrated as well as fed we're feeding you all the counter stroke you will need for this evening as our phase and rv already made it very clear this is going to be of a brawl yeah just phase are just feeling this out and right now no real banana presence other than the utility they've accomplished what they wanted to there's no info for navi over towards the b bomb site they're using retake utility right now but there is currently a gap it's just electronic and bit over towards a so phase get a move on they can apply pressure before the rotation comes back in and it looks like they're going for a holes pop yeah but with a lot of long util that might draw the rotate but it may lock them out on that side of a electronic his spidey senses are tingling so blind they caught a glimpse of him short already two in the pit rain quick find as well onto bit and just like that double entry from phase the site is theirs and they're bringing that same flare we saw just yesterday just that one molotov top banana so that navi couldn't push down and they were able to force their troops forward now carrigan's actually slipped past burma here if simple's not aware of this he could die and give up that awp pima is actually peddling back as well and broke he's trying to back him up so there's going to be a couple more deaths here with this bomb down for sure wait bro he's going all the way to t spawn he definitely doesn't want to lose this boomic i think he's heard it all of that i'm jumping around with his warp it's now taken away should be recoverable and booming could be hunted down here it looks like kerrigan set his sights on him oh nearly had the angle there should at least have a shot of this yeah spotted him out damage done twist has done some parkour and submits it to the store blog good stuff four to two we'll see the phase clan boys not only find the round access to the site the lovely entry fragging onto that pair bit and electronic we'll be seeing them test it a lot it seems yeah during that setup there as we mentioned it was three players over towards b so bit gets all that long utility coming into his face he tries to get into sight to tuck in in time and he's just not able to land the shots the same with electronic he's expecting them all to be flooding out of apartments together but they had already beaten that he was blind when two players had gotten up so it was really good spacing from phase in a moment like that but the money's still good and now we get themselves another buy here but one more round for faze and oh deary me break that economy simple is trying to be hyper aggressive towards mid isn't he certainly is brokey gonna be cut down to size boom and bit this time combining so that's some info at least the fact that bit was last seen dumping nades on bananas implies there'll be more a lot more nades to follow typically you're a player top banana control has been fought for phase confirming it with that sandbags molly we know boomich used to love a little banana bait he's added a bit more depth to his play hasn't he not just the sandbags you see him in the size i just remember you getting so triggered because he spent like  rounds at the same spot the problem is when the teams are using like three nades two molotovs a bunch of flashes to clear you out at that point you have to think maybe i should be somewhere else but that has happened you've seen a lot more depth at an rv in recent times operating as a team and well the team will have to defend against this a hit top mid control for olaf has been taken barebones bit just an m and a careful our vest to his name and olof has got his number that smoke will isolate him the sound q does bait the fight bit wins it out heavy disadvantage now for phase they may try and keep those boots planted i think kerrigan smoke may achieve that rain bomb on his back and starting a campaign towards the apartment electronic here he's gonna get run out again been having his fair share of woes baited again the movement from rain just enough to draw the crosshair away they're into the sight simple denies karrigan falling as well just twist now canadian sensation has already found two of the five electronic keeps a lid on it and we will see navi close that gap to just one round yeah good recovery there from electronic we were talking about how he struggled before that time cleans up the mess no dramas whatsoever and the reason just maybe you're thinking why is simple bothering to rotate over towards b well bit had full mid control right so at that point you're going okay well there's lots of info here they are throwing smokes over to the site where we don't have much information he'll start cheating over and he just hit pause he head back in time and he even bailed them out in a big way so four to three six days though that's crazy yeah narvi back in the studio in hard nose to the grindstone in preparation for this semi-final yeah i i just want to be clear i'm including today is prep time yeah what time is it yeah they've had uh from whenever they woke up this morning or this afternoon maybe those game arounds are in play oh stagnates convert boom it's down now they'll surely operate under the assumption that rotates on its way they've at least pulled one back and it's simple of all the players to find and to pull into the b site it's simple this is where kerrigan did his best work yesterday against gambit when they had that you know even when they went one for one and they were operating in v situations he was able to pull these rotations back and forth and right now navi don't have any map control whatsoever sure they just had their eyes on mid but now that that smoke has cleared there's no information this is a broken buy from phase look at what they're operating here with just a couple of flash bangs and one smoke so it feels that they commit towards this b bomb site they have to hope that this utility is perfect are they going to go for ct or are they going to go for coffins coffins would be the ideal that's where simple's playing right now flashes have hit simple he still hits his shot carrick as well falling simple standing strong here on the b side man advantage maintained he's they've got  seconds to solve this mystery and now finally bait the shot successfully a bit of control for twists and rain but there's no util how will they get that bomb down how they defend that peak from simple he bites his time himself i think electronic caught a glimpse on the orange p can they do line up for him lovely collection another multi kill for him in the bag looks like he's getting his feet back and firmly planted in the server after a slow start and as i said just at the uh cast to check in i was just saying that you know i think with faze's form at this point na'vi are gonna require the full three-man package simple bit and electronic have really partnered up to be the heavy fragging presence of this squad and so far so good yeah and bit is the question mark again here right the thing is he did have a good group stage there's no doubt about that but now it's the playoffs and we had the same conversation with gambit beat falls into the same category as four out of the five members on gambit right they're not tested in this environment now sure it's not even the big arena with people jumping up and down and shouting and the crowd roaring but it's still a land environment where the pressure is turned up right all eyes are on this event in the calendar year at counter-strike right now so if bits even able to replicate oh simple is just really jostling for this fight towards me he's such a jarring presence right now if he starts converting those kills fazer's gonna have a real rough time olaf olaf taking some real chances and he connects two bullets to the thigh of simple quick snap out a bit as well unarmored eagles shouldn't be much more to write home about after those just tests you see olaf dipping his toe in the water and not far off of taking the scalp of simple twist lingering in that app smoke could have a shot the warning shot straight into the poultry yeah get rid of those bloody pesky chickens they get in the way more often than not do look like heads especially when you're holding those headshot angles simple we'll collect another here in round nine makes it  total i think one of the big questions for faze obviously is are they going to be out of fake naviar in the same way they did gambit because that was a huge part of their play style is broken gonna have another absolute blinder already looking good at the gates right four four likely to be five four this one is only a matter of time now that we have roughly  seconds left twists he's gonna be set up for success here could have the element of surprise on that repeat did simple just jump for him vote yeah tucked down two to find here and the jump shots not a bad contribution but it will be five and avi will seize the lead face definitely resting on that comfortable three-round opener at this point in time navi stringing together three in a row themselves and you have to remember how those first three went three rounds went the pistol was great right they came in carrying out a knife kill but then the next two they were put under the pump they were putting the pump by the upgraded pistols and then by the saved galil simple getting the deagle shot boom is doing the same so they kept that pressure on so it's not like these four rounds that faze have been able to acquire so far have necessarily been of the easiest variety but the guns are back out this time no t-sided or brokey and well twist is going to send himself up banana he might get a jewel onto boomich bit bait steps wins the jewel again navi sees a very early three versus five it's quite hard for kerrigan to call the game he was calling when you lose two players so early into the piece there's usually power in numbers and you were talking about trades you know phases t side trades was uh a crucial component of their successes even in those four v five disadvantages neither of these openers from boomi and simple have been responded to still looking like they want to get b here smokes are in the sky good little lurk smoke will nullify blue mitch i say that he fires off some shots regardless fresh magazine required and here comes the commit three versus five phase would need a hero to step up isolate looks like brokies at least posted one they've got another to find and if they could spray him through the smoke brokey has provided the double they needed winnable now very winnable they've got retake simple in a prime position to drop the banana side smoke isolate kerrigan away from his squad post it up for now oh nade right on the nose but brokey holds his nerve bottom half ticked utah to be dropped tronic to deploy and that's the shot that's the jaw brokey still hitting shots finally silenced but time ticking in favor of phase the v has taken shape and all off the back of broken simples caught oh we're not off adjusting to electronic in the blink of an eye what a turnaround and brokie again delivers for phase when it matters most that's huge the round looks done right the round looks in the opening stages simple gets an upkill boomish gets that frag on a twist it looks like it's all over red rover look at this it's simple as this walk on in all right cool thanks rain we'll cat we'll grab that one and then broke he's able to walk on in sure the first kill was great the second they knew that perfecto was in the site right so it felt like only a matter of time and there wasn't really too much help for perfecto in that moment but that's a great transfer there from olof and that is going to put navi on the fringe here of having their ct side economy broken perfecto has gone for a cheapskate by just with the uh mp he has a lot of residual cash left and it looks like fazer getting a move on here heading up towards middle quite fast flashing through they're gonna go for present straight away this would be a mad call if they just started to rap long there's no way it's the perfect gap oh and a miss from simple carrick and what are you up to he's baiting shots left and right just dancing with simple finally gets the quick scope but they will exploit double found electronic is still in pitch you're meant to be they're trying perfecto only got that mp as we discussed they should be able to trade he's made it count great damage from perfecto he's delayed them he's held them at bay problem for olof as well navi stabilized brokey demanded to clutch again he's looking the wrong way electronical strike and rv will sigh as large sigh of relief financial troubles are averted yeah that's the thing right these pressure plays early from phase when they're just you know calling something out of the gate like this is almost from spawn maybe they reacted off of all that banana utility that they saw so they knew okay we can pressure this a site but even still it just puts them under the pump really lucky that perfecto got a kill there you could see how awkward that was under that porch position didn't look easy able to convert one and navi well they're able to keep themselves in this lead but once again the economy is still not great faze definitely not great they are going to be humbled here just down to these pistols they're watching phase in their quarter final if they could just win a couple more deagle armor round one would be great and it's definitely not been their strong suit carrigan falls early there's nothing quite like a booming bright yellow bulldozer mp it's a classic it's just it's the embodiment of him you know that is booming personified is the navi sticker triple mp yeah look at that that is him nimble irritating then if that's how i'd want to be described but that's what he is i think it's great to see how these in-game leaders have kind of chopped and changed the way they actually progress into the games like for the longest time it was believed that in-game leaders need to stay alive in the middle of the pack so they can keep calling the shots but actually sending them forward and using them as that i guess disruptive factor they can read the game quite well and if they do slip the net they're able to find even more impact but here we go brokey again why do i feel like he's about to blow perfecto's head off okay that's great tanks him off in the elbow and that forces the util out but navi hold their nerves so wherever phase go they've got a v into the site counting on their individuals with their weapon advantage don't forget no armor really shouldn't be too much of an issue and yeah it looks like that's exactly what na'vi needed they'll grab themselves a couple of sidearm upgrades but that will put them onto seven now one of the things to note here phase so far if i am uh well i forgot my glasses on correctly so far they've gotten four opening kills on this t side on the other side for na'vi on the ct side simple has uh three opening jewels successful right it's just that all being quite jarring he's uh definitely contributing in that regard now we're getting to the tail end here of the first half phase i'm sure they would love that six nine six would be pretty good simple very comfortable peeking down middle uh more than comfortable he's actually taking some chances good nade damage elsewhere simple will cancel on the second mid prior to wallop's arrival boom itch in his same heidi hall tucked into the sandbags and tanked up by the util oh it's a huge rotation right now so let's head it all the way back over towards b-side i think they're gonna post him up with the awp there's four there temporarily they're trying to chop and change but already it looks like phase of surge forward a little top mid is theirs electronics under the pump here i don't think he realizes it just now he wanted to actively contest it at least confirm the info i don't think he took a glance so right now top mid lost oh they're pivoting back towards b so back and forth phase a bit of a pendulum right here still lots of time to do this but they need to push simple off the line top banana he has the orb when he hits the shot i wonder if that'll change the plans here at phase i know that now is over towards b is he going to keep rotating i'm going to keep moving him around this has been such a dynamic one we've seen i mean almost every member of na'vi has been on b at one point just electronic the exception to the rule i think they've had enough of that back towards there we go there's still  seconds chad don't don't you dare lock in your final answer i don't know they keep knocking on different doors right now i don't know where faze want to go yeah but a knockadoor dash smokes deployed alongside that will surely incite boomish to dig his heels in two-man pit set up as well we saw how potent that was from the kovach cousins in our first semi this time it's from the ct's on the defense a perfect peak on the flash electronic caught a glimpse of moore and he hears the steps it should just be a brawl no one's looking olof's his next victim what could find from bit and electronic and they combine for a perfect defense yeah cleaned him up right there and for faze it just never felt like they could hit a site that they wanted to go to they're trying these fakey boy stuff that was working against gambit yesterday here it doesn't feel like they're stringing navi out in the same way and maybe that is because simple is happy to charge down mid with an orb then he's happy to rotate over a poster in banana the cts are happy to take these fights they're actually going toe to toe with the phase individuals right now and not giving them much space to work with whatsoever that's really good scenes out of navi early but yeah i suppose that's a real luxury for navi as a squad and for booming in particular you know if ever you're concerned about the a site you can just say simple play b yeah cool if you think you need help stack it's like when xy was able to play uh b for vitality for that period when they had navira in there and their ct setup just started looking super strong like whenever you want to really batten down the hatches on the a side just give simple a call send them over to the second letter of the alphabet again just the dx phase gonna be saving their pennies investing into that final round of this t side oh nice wide straight simple got the trigger discipline to find his time for that shot a couple more chances the needs are going to hurt ouch and if bit puts his head in the vice first oh simple struggling to hit kerrigan for some reason he enables garrigan to at least take bit down trying to get across he doesn't let it happen not easy and they hold it lock it down so we've just seen electronic and bit locked down the around and we've just seen electronic and simple in the following this is looking pretty comfy right just remember sure they have five rounds on the board but two of the five so far there were rounds where navi were very competitive they were playing the long game they were harming that economy and more often than not yeah i know he has  kills i know i know the thing is if we just talk about that that's all we're gonna do we can't so it's really it's like we're we're screwed no matter what we do the guy's gonna kill everybody but we can't talk about him the entire time no because then it's just yeah yeah there's definitely other elements to this we'll do our best right it's not easy when the guy's almost dropping  in the first half yeah just on track for the  if he keeps that up well he's on track if he gets an ace here either in this or the grand final if they make it simple will break the record right now in big events players at the most simple has tied that record i think there's eight of them in total with three aces in a big event if simple gets the fourth he will break the record it's kind of crazy to me no one has ever done that they've all like we've had multiple multiple people get three aces in a tournament yeah okay so records could be broken on this map never mind in this semi-final we almost did it right there four kills so uh if electronic didn't get that frag we would have been popping off in a big way celebrations the streamers come out i think they've run out with a cake they take a time out peter watch on tv he teleports in he gives him the award i i don't know exactly you know that you know the uh admins have got the gloves on that's just in case we have to get the um twizzle what what are they called whistlers no sparklers okay i think twizzlers are like a sugary dessert yeah no that's definitely all turkey twizzlers which were just processed pretend turkey they served in canteens okay you ever have a turkey twizzler i don't think i did i wouldn't recommend it to a friend yeah i might avoid that now it looks like we have a little bit of a time out situation here ladies and gentlemen this is of the technical varieties oh so back to the turkey twizzlers well look i don't know how long we have hopefully it's not too long but uh we have our favorite observer with us right now russell one two three four five six russia with us hello now before we get back in you your mic is terrible say what you want to say i just want to say hello shroud shout outs uh oh that's pretty much it all right goodbye raj all right see you later our boy shroom yeah shroud noticed one of rush's pro tips and he seemed to enjoy it on his stream so rush just wanted to say hi you know so uh i would give him that opportunity and it's good we got it out of the way in the first half of the first map because hopefully this one delivers just like the gambit series yesterday and we can get an absolute bang as a match is coming everybody's way yeah i mean i'm i i kind of got mad at myself for writing phase out at times because every step of the way you know they don't make it look easy it's always like a bar brawl they're always walking with a limp at the end of every map but they've done it you know they've done it to vitality they've done it to heroic they did it to gambit i'm just gonna just sit back relax and enjoy the show na'vi however if they can post themselves a tenth here this is faze's pick it's what they consider their best shot and the t side definitely they have a real prowess for the attack however posting nine against gambit on their ct side just yesterday maybe things can change good flash both blind electronic was ahead of it actually doesn't stop rain finding him good contribution from the viking simple still sticking around he wants the jewel he just finds it hunts down twists on the repeat is he pushing for more you wouldn't well he's smoking off boiler which means he can keep contesting that midline but here he goes again keep moving the orb around keep that man versatile he's heading over towards b perfecto now greeting bit over towards this a site so it's a two-two split right now and these four vs as i mentioned earlier is webface did some good work yesterday let's see if kerrigan can pull off some similar tricks he's already here as kerrigan tries his nutmeg and it has worked out wonderfully good play from kerrigan broke he slips the net flash forces simple off the line it's in limbo here so he will be able to commit if he hears anything the rookie's going to be tested bits in pit right now he needs at least one kill this is a big moment for him they're hitting the side they're actually smoking off towards the arch side the rap onto bit here is some hard fights - sounds a whole lot better than - perfecto here's the bit ready zame doesn't quite hit the mark smoke to play around in a flash for the peak already up graveyard though and they have the sight oh reign has the bomb it's thrown forward but it's perfecto that stands and delivers  seconds perfecto taking some chances runs out of options nice find its bit that does find and contribute the final frag  for navi phases pick heading to the defense let's see if simple and the boys from rv can close this one out with ease do you think you know everything about cs go then stay alert and look out for the dhl drop

place around inferno and you'll see a lot of scaffolding now don't let this put you visiting this picturesque town the scaffolding will give you clear views and quite possibly a vantage point to take

site on inferno can be pretty tough however the molly orange injury i'll show you all today will help clear out one of the little hidey holes a tee could be in to throw this molly secure runes first then get into the corner next to the sandbags aim up and place your crosshair in the midsection of the ruined roof between these two points get your crosshair in line with this kink and the scaffolding then simply running jump through the molly as you can see here this tee did smoke the molly but from this angle you can see that the molly does in fact completely coat the area in flames good luck and happy retaking no stranger to victory born to win as they say in latin and we'll go up against them is faze clan certainly looking good for it at least  to the good five posted by faze on their attack and definitely seeing some of the stars of that roster thrive in this land environment we're into the semi-finals looking to separate these two definitely a hot favorite is navi in the center of the mall i just realized simple's in the middle not breaking that in-game leadership uh central seat trend i had a tweet the other day someone actually had been paying attention to all the cameras and had written a list of like the players cool i don't have a handy but i think there was quite a few that didn't have the in-game leader sitting in the middle so look back in the old days that's how you do it right the in-game leader in the middle called the shot some of the variations to that is having your author in the middle so you can see more players screens right also yeah i just think it's based on setups as well right like who gets to see their teammates monitor if you're on your ct setups i imagine that's a big influence well that's why by having that and just so everybody knows here look we want to get the game under well underway as much as you do but we're having a pc replacement right now so bear with us right we'll get that one fixed asap we want the best conditions for everybody in the server right now this is a semi-final winner will go on to play g in that grand final but yeah as you were saying having simple in the middle as an awpa or other operas in the middle because you're moving around right a lot as an author you're able to see the information you're not only just trusting what your teammate is calling you can reference the exact angle that they're holding you can do all of that right and that's some of the things being on land that's what gives you the different elements here to play with yeah and you don't even ever have to ask those questions like you know any one banana you can truly just glance at his monitor and answer that question for you now make sure when you do that guys if you ever go to a local land and you try that maneuver make sure you're not just holding an angle in the open like a tit because uh that's the moment you look away from your screen and they strafe out and they headshot you and you you never want that to happen that's already frustrating enough as it is yeah but all this nuance we're discussing is part and parcel of what falls under the experience you know when we talk about experience these are the just the quirks and the nuances that are part of the game we love counter-strike global offensive for example with bit you know he's got a couple of heavy lessons to learn during this this is his playoff run ester tournament a lot to be uh processed for him there's a lot of new information and it already seems to be a really great addition to the navy roster in terms of just not having the nerves get the better of him yeah sitting there nine kills uh not too many dramas there perfecto has nine you got eight for boomitch obviously uh electronic into that second star still continuing his good performance with  and simple well  kills for him we'll go through phases well right now brokey and twist they're topping the scoreboard with  a piece reign the next with nine five for olaf and four for carrigan and maybe we'll pick up that carrigan point right now because if you were tuning in yesterday and you saw the phase versus gambit match up go down carrigan was quite instrumental in some of their tea rounds about finding space or finding entry kills now on the t side just there at one moment i think he had about two kills right so he was struggling in a map like this and i think just the jarring nature of navi and how hyper aggressive simple was being with the awp meant that more utility has to be used before they can take all that space right so a bit tougher of a ct defense to break than gambit's yesterday but everybody's just having a chat so this one might be a lengthy one if you want to go grab a snack right now go to the bathroom now would be the time to do it or if you want to sit here and listen to alex and i do uh one of the favorite things in esports which is called filling uh we'll probably smash it and at some point it'll turn into a podcast so don't you worry about that oh careful now we nearly read all the notes sure well i don't know is it what what's the is it cyrillic yes okay so that right there i have no idea uh i'm just getting through the english letters actually to be honest yeah well i was trying to so i wanted to be able to say the na'vi players full names all right go give it a crack if you're if you're a russian speaker right now so from my understanding i was talking to carmack he's he can he tried to help me out a little bit the k is often silent um and i'm really scared of saying bits so we'll do that one last if we have serious comeback or do we have comment that's going to troll you it's not i don't think he's trolling okay alexander costelli if we can do that one yeah and right now he's playing with his keyboard what is he up to is he taking all the keys out what's going on here imagine if we were actually just waiting for simple to build his keyboard like sorry i just got new keycaps got to change them yeah bardot send them to me actually yeah they're bout off making all the keyboards for the pros that would be like the that he would be like back in the day you know how they'd craft armor you know that's that's bad if he's in there in the workshop so electronic and simple i can do dennis sharapov okay love that all right i think sharapova that's how i'm doing it all right um tennis player yeah okay yep yep boomitch now this is where it gets interesting the silent k so it's kiril mihalov mihailov you're normally very good with the pronunciation so i reckon a couple cracks and you'll probably get i'll get there i'll get that i'd love to be able to whip their names out uh at the drop of a hat perfecto is a good challenge ilya salutsuki man you're really setting yourself like you can fumble so many ways with these i don't think so all right i have faith the lutsky salute yeah i'm not butchering it all right he says absolutely no guarantee and our final the one i'm most scared of is of course bit  years of age by the way he's a baby valerie apparently you just don't say okay all right well it sounds okay to me i i believe you thank god pc replacement is currently happening if anyone just tuned in it's like caster stop talk omg well olaf was the man standing up so i assume that his pc was probably the one getting replaced and now he's sitting i don't know that's i'm just guessing here but either way the headsets are getting on and real top tier analysis here from machine tv it looks like twist is not chewing gum right now that was a big thing on the intel grand slam run he was chewing every round so we'll keep an eye on that whether that implica has implications into his form interesting scientific studies scientific studies imply it does aid concentration and focus i need anything to help with that so maybe i gotta get chewing some gum he also has a pretty killer jawline as well at times i think that's part and parcel of the whole gum situation anyway talking of nonsense let's get maybe just quickly rehash how that first half transpired because chances are a couple of new viewers have joined us during that uh timeout all right well uh phase they grabbed the pissed around it was absolute destruction then the second and third it got a bit shaky navi went for the force by they took away some guns then on the third round navi took away even more guns rounds started to flow simple was jarring he ended up with  kills within that first half and then the gun rounds for now for faze in that first half was spotty they only managed two uh on the tail end of that and one was on round number six one was on round number ten so navi with a very dominant ct half right there but a - score line you're not you're not unhappy with that as phase we know that their best work has been done on the ct side we know this is where the individual step up with the multi kills and i'm so glad you mentioned phase individuals because right now everything like the recipe is there you've got three multi-kill rounds out of brokey you've got three multi-kill rounds out of twists this was on the t side bear in mind so already it's a good sign of things to come broke you had that hero round with the ak that's right and that is where one of the gun rounds came from so if you consider that the gun round's maybe not even the most convincing type for face but it doesn't matter a round's around when you're in an environment like this game time here we go all right rock and roll this pistol will be instrumental there's the cliche i said it get over it rv over up to  phaser up to five and we have swapped sides we see a lot of util on kerrigan he's definitely not got his fragging socks on today certainly not yet but that didn't stop him being a crucial component of their t sign baiting all of that shots out of simple let's get it started rv bring in the pain train the glock train indeed four kevlar vests p so armored and equipped with a p for simple and no aggression out of the ct side here one x bet odds at the top of your screen clearly favoring navi in this one electronic gonna deal with any uh second mid pushes through that t house they have three players nesting together in banana and boomers gonna make his way over as well so they're getting all this territory for free right now fazer making a gamble call that this will be an a play now if reign takes contact the question is does he save his nade until kerrigan comes over and they try and double nade the plant or does he just do as much damage as he can do they just fully plan to just go off boom at util they might even just go off simple peeking here with the p they have so much faith in this man they are like they're peaking they're wide right now oh oh rain playing a dangerous game the little warning shot across the bow simple may be deterred and that could be it imagine if that one tag on too simple is enough to channel them all into the stack and it is they are starting to gallop towards the a site brokey ready to receive them he kind of wants to let them in a little bit here doesn't want to be too much of a force of resistance and it's worked out nicely tucked in they stroll on in -second mark reached actually heading back towards bottom of banana where's he gonna use his util right now if it is towards a this stack from carrigan is looking absolutely genius it's gonna be a three-man apartments pop and twist and all if they're ready for this straight into the stack all off to bait carrick and confirm his presence long they're into the pit this is the bait and switch one for one they won't expect twists they won't oh but they do bit pops off triple kill on the glock problems now brokey can try and change things the bombs still not planted and that smoke's only gonna be a small guys for his bunny hops they're both getting peppered p will finish the job perfecto scavenges it away rain however kicking and screaming he knows it's a v boomish on the side bit did get that bomb down on default half health no armor it doesn't favor him at all norwegian eight bullets to fly his trade one spotted on the cross back and i think they may have both slipped the net okay now that kick could be the element of surprise imagine booming confirms he's not on the bomb they're gonna play with him here bit look how passive he is he's not giving him any chances hold it brave pros don't fake not to be and instead he'd navi just get to play and pull him off the bomb they'll secure the round looks like eleven is secured and rain just being danced with oh it finishes it with pizzazz he makes it four quite the announcement of his presence into the t side yeah and boomers just playing cat mouse with them there right you don't even need to get the kill you just have to delay him from diffusing that bomb so so great stuff and it didn't look like it was going to be great for a moment but you really have to put this on two factors here the fact bit gets three kills look at that transfers to the site and then has the presence of mind yeah that's crazy that right there is where twist could have completely changed the script of that round the reason twist is hiding in that moment is to set him up for success he needs to get one if not two kills from that position so the fact that bit deals with him well they've taken away a lot of pressure here phaser into the force the deagles are out but under pressure already rain's been pushed back to the site it's charged on up here he's got four teammates or three with him the fourth man electronic he's dealing with that second mid push and they're just trying to apply a lot of pressure towards banana here the reason you want to do this early is to bait out these ct smokes now rain and carrigan they were pretty stoic they didn't drop one just yet the clock at . and these can come into play later in the rounds here so not getting away with what they wanted retake utility towards top banana now everything's called clear rain can give that information to his in-game leader character gets to move on back towards a and here comes navi well that's a good nade oh they evade nicely top mid is navi's flying that black and yellow flag olaf close chance and throws a nade of his own design this one much more successful simple swallows it bits finished off nicely kept even as perrigan's adventure is cut short here we go twists he's not only found the frag onto electronic he's found a weapon to play as well they're charging in to be currently smoked should be fading shortly shortly yeah rain will be a lot at least allowed to tuck into the site here's the steps brookie's here as well this is looking good for faze this is in the right place  seconds it's a question of his next frag hard shot he's found the head and the rest should be broke he's good find from simple he's been brought down even lower but he's still kicking for hp surely you give boom it's the ak yeah the swap and change all off from banana with an mp a smoke as well but for now it's about this crossfire and breaking it no kit air of pace required and all of smoke might draw them into the fights this is not a bad shout you know oh confirms new box and that's the healthy one trying to isolate twist walks in simple with low hp you can't get both you can't you can he only needs a mac . get out of his server oh it just looks way too easy there doesn't it the hp doesn't matter at all and he's still giving a critique right here they win the round but he doesn't worry about that come on boys let's tidy it up which way you peak let's tidy it up i have to win with  hp and mag . the pressure's on simple to convert here right all it is is a stray bullet that's all it would have been right now and look the time if that kill comes in it would have just been there for twist to get that diffused so that's huge from simple and yeah boomers you're gonna be sweating right there he's giving you that ak- it's not gonna matte up too much as they forced again this is unusual from phase it's something isn't it all of charging down middle as well you'd think the nade would imply some aggression simple not caught out not having any of it  and counting as he knocks another down good catch broke it to the toes but simple undeterred more tags he's actually got another frag up of that what's happening to this man he is just ascending his eyes are going wiped his hair as well this is a crazy force by from faze back to back four spies on the ct side you don't see this at all you always hear me talking about it there's always a chance you know if you're feeling super cocky about things and now that they've lost two men immediately right here this is the worst possible scenario for phase more damage done electronic chipped on down to . but rain and carrigan they're the walking wounded as well right now i mean navi would still have like have to slip up right at this point but the thing is for face they've just dug themselves such a huge hole they have to go for a gamble stack phase they're gambling on a rain's coming over joining kerrigan and twist over towards this arch side they all have mps if they walk into the b bomb site right now navy you've won the round of perfecto he's about to get a lot of information there's one oh oh he's just seen everything b's completely open he's called all that info what a horrible round for phase to go down like this yeah and i mean you like you said right gamble three if you keep all three alive you maybe recover from that uh investment there's nothing in terms of weapons to be recovered and even a bit of a hunt going on why wouldn't you when you're electronic you've got a mac  to play with and you will at least press your ear to the wall and listen for any ct sound cues i can't stress enough how much of a hole they're in if they lose all these guns right sure they're going to get the lost bonus to  into the next but then this you know they'll just keep going rifle round coming in next the next has to be just a partial upgrade right it can't be a force they haven't done as much damage as they did in the previous round it wasn't one player surviving now it's four now if you get to stretch their legs in a huge way what a risky call by phase look i can respect it you're trying to keep that pressure on but that just felt desperate bomb goes off  secured and you know what keep those mps it might come back to bite them i don't think so though that just i can't believe simple as well gets two in that moment in mid there's so much pressure coming in they're running out of them the scout's picking middle they're able to mop it up here  to five i wonder what they're discussing whether that is a conversation about what buy they just played against yeah and you know what else is strange we've played a bunch of rounds of counter-strike here we're going into round number . not a single timeout has been taken from either team and you think phase now that they're in this hole maybe it'd be time to take one soon they've gone for a partial bite they get max loss notice in that next round right so they will be able to purchase on up but that will be potentially just a four round out the gate for navy not having to contest against rifles no rifles at all oh now that's a scalp you can write home about olaf a fix is simple to his belt loop bomb to be retrieved i mean this could be the recovery this would require our gargantuan effort from the boys of faze clan utility check your a defender twist is equipped with a smoke carrigan over on b to delay with his there goes twists locks down the long smoked up does still enable navi to stroll in and confirm mid is theirs look if they win this one now that could wipe away you know the dramas that would have been this would have been the rifle round anyway and here they're going to get some upgrades off the back of it so their economy is actually going to be in a buffer position so this is a really important round for phase right now and as you said a huge scout to take simple down he'd love to have held onto the smoke but drops it at . it looks like navi will be propelled now towards the a side of the map twists high flash keeps them honest no one slipped the net just yet bit however catching brokey that's great from twisty gets away long range with the mp and electronics down  seconds tuck in and he has managed to get towards the cold zero box olof playing a good despoiler position as well bit was last seen in the apps big fine from boomi tested and that's a big frag to find rain can't deny into the site perfecto on the reload suddenly a v they know where you are they can recover they need this headshot and they find it three from rain on the way in that is huge i i cannot just as much as i was talking about that was a nightmare for faze to go for the force behind the fall flat to recover like this this is just as big that buffer right now it got so chaotic there i thought they had done enough boomers just getting run in on pedal to the metal right there that's a huge round for faze to snatch back all things considered and they grab a couple of aks out of that oh that was navi's chance they could have just netted this one up i mean this is rain great recovery after seeing bit kill olaf in pitt and the fact that rain ignores that pit call charges into the site and finds two then enabling kerrigan and him to partner up for the final frag that just suddenly makes face competitive here in our second half game on i think there's enough money right now for navi to go for a buy definitely so you can see the purchases coming on through it's gonna be five aks but look at fazer's purchase right the ops out for broken out we'll see if we can find more of that impact from yesterday over towards top banana nice in this boy's veins i swear has him how in the shot on that log's peak it looks like perfecto wants to have a glance nade on his nose safe spot found they may assume it's clear and they do rain finds an easy a freebie oh he's dancing around the nades as well this guy's looking cool calm and already collected one they've gotten the space at least right it's gonna be hard for phase to apply too much pressure towards top banana now you still have carrigan and rain both have smoke so they can deny the entry but rv in the past you've seen electronic as an individual he likes to snake up behind these smokes and pounce on through oh simple spotted out by kerrigan in a smoke drop with no gap flip knife gang there's no info right now for na'vi across the map they're playing a passive setup over towards the a side broke he's in library twisters him back a pit you got olaf as well in a passive position rain and kerrigan are both in the sides about to be a two on four on this b bomb site unless broke he starts rotating now brain's been holding this flashbang for so long i wonder what he can profit from that  goodie does deploy it symbols are ready through the ct smoke oh dear i don't know if brokey caught a glimpse of that i think he did yeah he's acknowledged it's a possibility if he finds this that's gonna be a three versus four blue mitch into the site electronic contributes as well the site is there's brokey though with the york would need another and he's found it bit trying to plant it will he deny doesn't not for the wall bank bites his time plays the numbers advantage i love working his way in from banana he may not be expecting someone so close did he catch a glimpse doesn't matter electronic confirms banana is no longer a threat mission accomplished in that regard brookie knows where they both are though he knows he's going to be poolside and banana and now it's about timing sound cute both there stepping in bit delivers the head electronics strafes out and  is secured that's a great one to recover there now v they lost that man early perfecto going down to that molotov from rain and uh well the one that reigns playing behind and they're able to recover that round and that was even with brokie finding simple right the fact that he's caught him there in that moment is either sound q record a little bit of a glimpse either way it doesn't matter this is the kill that alleviates all the pressure as soon as electronic gets this one all of that focus could now be towards the ct or coffin and the jewels become easier for bitten electronic and they're able to pick that one up  to six the scoreline now and that residual cash well it's got brokey and up again but the buy's a bit scuffed right here yeah and it doesn't look like navier being held at bay by this phase utils march playing with fire quite literally nades galore carrick and wants more he's peeking on this that is brave he gets nothing rain has to do with all that he has found two is it gonna be enough the bombs loose they may not commit off this the util exchange twist trying to keep them at bay i think it will work i say that simple straight straight through they don't have to bomb this is very quirky they'll be holding this for a while simple doesn't miss how is that a headshot he's aiming at his toes dude that's the high sense broke he was talking about well now he's felt it firsthand the bloodlust oh he's looking so high over the smoke get out of here get out of here simple nonsense in the server tonight one more kill for . look at him jump no scope flick around honestly like i don't believe in the devil but simple starting to make me believe a little more he's just here to make you a tone oh come on mate give him a break give him an absolute break the smile on the face i think it says it all what have we had  run rounds of play and the guy's got  kills let me see these i mean just bullying them four as well like we you know he's trying to break records here could someone just stop stealing the fifth he's done that that's two quad kills we've seen from simple so far actually no don't give him that eight i want to see a classic people taking that ace clutch give me the ace clutch finale oh this shot by the way look this is a head shot pay attention oh it's crazy right because he just distinguished oh my lord he's just extinguished and ran on in wild scenes right here fazer broken money in the bin looking like it could be a - score line oh i love that mix-up that's enabled them to find an opening kill it hasn't always necessarily translated into a round now navi look like they're pivoting pretty quickly towards mid right now it is just all off towards this short side with the deagle in hand he's been spotted up electronic not able to do any damage there information taken so that's good for olaf to get the get the info on get on out in that video simple did what's the one tip of advice you'd say to your teammates aim higher i caught that as well what role shouldn't he do i think it was coach that was igl yeah oh he's tagged hold off straight through the pit wall they are testing to say defense and looks like boomer just had no issues with twists four on four now they've clawed it back and great timing kerrigan punishes boom itch bomb may have been spotted electronic was pushed up here on brackets and olof wants to have a little look wasn't expecting the pushed up player gets a little pantsed there and carrigan's taking a gamble and it's the right one why is his brain so big oh he's just come over and throwing a smoke so i actually think he'll pivot back over towards a to at least deal with that arch side so that buys a bit of a buffer right now for rain and it's done enough to dissuade navy and force them back over towards this a site but really unless they go outside this is all on broaky oh kerrigan's timing here if he keeps pushing forward he might catch them all oh it depends on when they look away simple patrolling confirms they're all there broke he reads himself for battle five bullets in the chamber needs to make him count bits already called him out good shot combines with kerrigan's for mass nine seconds more shots needs to delay electronics the one with the bomb simple to body guard he just doesn't miss it that was his chance and there goes phases misses his chance as well so a one-on-one is established electronic can finish it right here and now it's carrigan to try and step up for his third electronic maneuvering around the side kerrigan on the hunt just playing with him and he does extend play faze say go again well they keep that one alive there and it felt like simple just done enough one more time that's that bloodlust was simple right the fact that he just hit in every shot it's so hard to you know if it was any other player you could go well he probably shouldn't have gone for that but how can you critique it when he's pulling off this he's got  kills at this point he's just absolutely destroying phase and there is enough money for navi to go for another buy this is one of those maps now with the scoreland at  to  that feels like a matter of time but that's the fighting spirit from the captain in-game leader over there from phase that you want to see not letting this one fall and he had a lot of good info plays right his smoke top bananas what pushed them back in towards the a site broke did a good job dancing around the box and then to just stay calm this is a two on one situation mind you and converts right that's against electronic and simple so great stuff from kerrigan there you have to turn in moments like these he's given him another chance to voice some concerns to get under navi skin this is a first map of the series as well three two split four phase they've got broca's orb to rely upon on this b site and he's playing one of my favorites this one almost guarantees that first frag rain with some util to bail him out with that flashbang cocked it's very hard not to go down on this line you need a perfect jiggle or a perfect flash might be both smoke starting to sail through the air now perfect flash forced off garrigan only has the incendier he's waiting for steps he wants to hear the commitment until starting to sail i think they're gonna get through this they are on their way brokey ops for the pillar rayne trying to keep them at bay the flashes are so good but he still stands strong brokey counting on those teammates they do fall eventually but take some with them and that's a big contribution kerrigan stepping up traded by perfecto it's the a defenders perfecto and bit up against them kid available smoke as well they've got everything they could require will they flirt with the boost bits already pre-aiming it so much uncertainty for all off and twist they don't know where they are i think they're just called banana clear they can now focus towards spawn and coffins again they make it clear as well as the flash goes in looking the wrong way precise is perfect and that's navi  clinical stuff from the black and yellow behemoth - up in the series and one map away from that grand final
