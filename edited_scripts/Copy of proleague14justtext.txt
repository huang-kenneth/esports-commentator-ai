mmm it's creamy there's a kind of a strawberry vibe to it nice i thoroughly enjoyed that thank you very much to everyone that got me a nice creamy birthday surprise let's get this one started simple oh simple simples not starting fantastically he's got what a flash and some hot lead out of those clocks and i don't think the smoke's going to stop him chad oh one expert odds here favoring rv but probably not for the pistol round gonna have this bomb side taken away from them they're out of util for the retake on the site and reigns just having fun the burst fire glock through the smoke perfect is gonna wonder what he did yeah i was actually really proud of harry when he told me he went he spent two three weeks practicing burst fire respect like plus one thumbs to him i don't know if he's going to be practicing the uh right-click alternate fire of the glock though don't think that's got much of a place in modern counter-strike yeah it's a different story isn't it look i always still go to it out of habit yeah it's a bad habit that is habit what do you think is the possible justification for not having it being relevant like what's the point in having the button to press well i might have to do i might have to do what harry did and try using these things consistently it took us like four years to use the org yeah exactly right so maybe just maybe we're all wrong on this one and volvo arrived but pissed around to phase a great way for them to kick off the campaign here you heard the desk talking about the multitude of different outcomes here this evening we'll be keeping you up to date trying to give you live updates so apologies to those of you who wanted to watch all three games separately over the next three days of play uh but we will be giving you little spoilers it's pretty inconsiderate of yourself isn't it really sorry how dare you guys competitive integrity being upheld oh it's a bit of a topic isn't it integrity i'm not sure if i'm ready for that kind of conversation chad is a bit late for that one oh i had a whole day about integrity it was a bloody it was a day so sit down relax and just enjoy the shooty shooty bang yeah this is the stuff i know what i'm talking about forget about all of the extra integrity and like look like paper and ink and law none of that no thank you well it's a bit of a sticky situation for faze clan here there was four players top banana to deal with their early aggression and that's sent them packing trifle with the mid play smoke will be fading shortly in limbo back and forth is bit simple has been able to find himself roost over towards the arch side and to be fair simple had a bit of an off game on inferno yesterday against eg it is brave of them don't you think like straight up rematch on the map you got banged out by simple  frags  to . just saying okay do it again just asking him mr castillo have you got another one in here oh nice pronunciation merci beaucoup flash wars as kerrigan does take the space  seconds here really starting to clamp down on this a bomb site okay so there's a real pressure on to the time of this those smokes are going to start fading they already have carrigan you're going to need a second one he refreshes the arch and they continue their walk navi are in the right place to receive this there's still ways in which this can go wrong all it takes is a well-timed push or a good spray out of the mp electronics been kept very honest it looks like faze have weathered the storm yeah i've been able to hold that one at bay there and you could just see the moments where it could go wrong but taking their time phase making sure to get down multiple walls of smokes see if navi wanted to test the water it's a it's a balance isn't it in counter-strike where like i think sometimes we see kerrigan do the other side of it where you kind of overthink and overcook it but you know the the idea of just being blatant like at no point were faced secretive about their intentions there and i know sometimes i know i find myself second-guessing it when it feels like it i know the cts have had time to be there you know yeah i think the thing is in counter-strike you can get caught in two minds like out-positioning your opponent to make it as easy as possible can sometimes force you into a scenario where you know you scamper you try and run away and instead that unravels the play whereas if you go okay well we know there's two guys here we know this one guy here how about we just focus in on that like we know they could have pushed banana they could be flanking middle they can already be in the smokes we've just thrown but let's not get uncomfortable and let's continue yeah just deal with the task ahead of you right they knew that they had the better weapons they knew that now v we're gonna have to scramble to make those maneuvers and they've been able to get the second round on the board now actually it's been strange i've been seeing and this is just the eye test everybody but some of these second second round saved forces right so they haven't forced they've saved some weapons into this they can seem just as threatening if not more so regardless of the full investment rv is still a threat here great defensive molotov there yeah i'm convinced a part of what you're talking about there is also because i think all all it takes is the absence of the kevlar to give players just that little extra motivation to go for an aggie peak early and more often than not when you've got players as well oiled as navi and faze they get they profit from that opening gambit it's weird that there's layers to that right because we already say when you're on a lower bow with pistols you're gonna take risks so what you're implying here is that there's more risk taken when you know there's just not the head armor right so i can see what you're talking about because the there you go this is the first piece of that puzzle yeah there's even a weapon that they have to control olaf's feeling the heat i will remind you encounter to the   bang our iem cologne odof did have a very hot i can nearly set the word correctly very hot inferno just yesterday up against big clan dropping a dirty  and pulling them across the line now this is already getting sketchy chad this has to be but this is a four or five man retaker ak has fallen into simples hands and that was an important frag to find how was perfecto pulled that one off brokey should have had more there and carrigan's lost his life as well this one's gone he needs something special here twist just over the elevation from simple doesn't have him in his field of view and it's an easy collection it's an easy four kills from simple as well the kind of second component of that conversion is that it's all simple well really you think faze has done all the hard work in round number two and here it is just that uh naughty naughty little five seven there in boiler room just causing so much strife defuse will come in simple has . grand after that four kills plus the defuse plus they were already on a save does he keep the ak or does he go for the big slam dunk awp that's a great question i think you can probably get away with this ak right now you know let everybody else invest as the opera maybe hold your schmeckles in his sack yes indeed any sack but phase with the plant they can facilitate a buy it's looking good on their side of things too so regardless of that result there for navi we will get a full gun round coming into round number four and banana we go boomich he's in the most forward position here lobs out of molly carrigan will negate all that with his smoke and they've got top and out of control quite swiftly here faces of the flash and speaking of flash you can see kerrigan wants to get the hell out of dodge interesting that he's not interested in the maintaining control you can see a reactive utility set from navi a smoke on booming a flash from perfecto everyone playing it very safely and passively understandably so i suppose with the three-man stack on a but they bowed out completely here so i think the idea was they're expecting rv to go for something a little bit more aggressive and now just as a crew they're walking on up and they have everything they need to go straight for a bee execute into the bomb site of perfecto and burmitch yeah they've got such clear intentions from the get-go haven't they oh this is all going to come down to timing for phase here brookie's setting something up perfect they're getting boosted in the meantime it'll be safe from the molotovs there presuming it doesn't break upon it oh the timing is perfect as it fades reigns walk is completely neutralized they're gonna have to commit off this and they are olaf trying to be the pointy end but perfecto another connection through the smoking phase limping with what little remains into this b bomb side the rotate is in nades swallowed broke his vision just restored but kerrigan's got a wealth of space my god i just looked at the map nine hp though he's gonna have to do something crazy here like trying to keep simply coming in oh he does prefa is lovely simple is his next challenge and he's already managed to at least tuck in they can plant here you can get a graveyard i don't know how he's chosen to stick around so long this is very brave from kerrigan he's playing for the greater good simple will catch the first brokey trying to slip away at v can't even get much more simple will deal with him and there you have it two impact four rounds out of that ak from simple phase managing to get us something out of that i mean a recovered plan yeah is is significantly more than they were about to leave with prior to kerrigan's maneuver yeah all things considered that's great but look at navi now they have four aks to their name going into the fifth round of play here now i just want to talk through the details of this you can see that booming expended all of his utility early and perfecto still had the bucket load left so what happened was booming transitioned into the site perfecto boosts him up into a position where he can just focus on shooting and perfecto with utility is playing from that ct role where he can be a little bit more flexible and you can see just how his utility there was really able to aid them in defending that site but faze well they've been pushed down to pistols here and those pesky deagles need to see if they can find a few heads in rv just takes one and the dominoes will start to fall forced out an early mid smoke here so that was above the  minute mark going to force out more utility of navi booming on the jump spot yeah he's in that same mindset well aware of the buy and willing to take a chance on someone not hitting that it's a shot that's hit it's definitely there's a precedent set that it can and will be punished if you continue to go for jump peaks on the half wall but face with nothing posted looks like simple wants to clear out top mid with the support of electronic and that's easy i think he remembers what was happening yesterday against brees so uh simple's laying some pain down range right now yeah i mean we got to see simple stubbornness for the apartments as well it was interesting to see how much breeze forced him to actually actively fight for that territory well this is one of those rounds where i think carrigan has just gone hey let's get some deagles and let's go and see what we can find everybody go fishing go at your own leisure go at your own pace well at least rinse through some of this util but uh being rinsed right now and said we might have some more kills and if you're phase clad right like i think everyone when they know like they wake up in the morning and they know they're playing against simple and later in the day part of you maybe even just for a second wonders hey you might have an off day you know it would be cool if you had an off day and then you know all it takes is five rounds of counter strike and you realize oh he's he's here isn't he yeah he's here in full capacity isn't he had two k rounds already in the context of those k rounds well that one that you just saw that's more farming kills but the first four that he had uh that was the ones that are whacking the eco loss yeah that was the phase the that has now been a reaction of three so from zero two we find ourselves with navi taking the lead heading into our next round of play and the awp now out for the aforementioned superstar across their place and patrolling for any aggressive heads and so they won't necessarily provide initially two up second mid safely kerrigan floating around middle as well should he desire he's looking very a-heavy right now from face-up no banana control and that's huge from rain and opening towards the apartments electronic is down and now more pressure can be applied oh carrigan's got something in store for us here whether there's a full commit the apps pop perhaps brokey carrigan all released their nades here we go to see navi's reaction he's flashed off but he still pulls the trigger on to a back turned reign info on beer he's fully blind and executed now simple can get overwhelmed here he's done very well trying to dig himself out of trouble through the flames they push and round converted faze have successfully taken the a site yeah that was quite nice i think that mid control you see that molly right there out of carrigan's hands lands under the porch you can throw different variations maybe intentionally or by accident if you lob it a little bit too early might land on the roof you throw it a little bit late might land a little bit deeper on porch you know so there's different variations that happen with that but it looked like just the mid control and they were able to pounce out apartments find that gap a bit he had no idea what was going on simple tries to make the best of a bad situation and phase well they're gonna tie things up three three so a highly contested game early here and important for us to stay that way we wonder if a bit of a banger this group has definitely delivered a different breed of counter strike it's been much closer we're not going to get away with the five four three two one zero no way no way but i also feel like that's because that's a product of the team's oh that well that's a nothing statement i realize that's that's a product of the teams within it yeah okay hold on but i had justifications behind that uh just in terms of like i'm thinking about big clan i'm thinking about faze clan like these are teams that will new fanatic but well they're just yes certainly but those two in particular that i mentioned i think are more attributed to just the volatility of the opponent like if they have a well-suited opponent i think they fall into categories where they have teams they mesh against well and teams they don't necessarily match against well i think that doesn't i wouldn't put navi in that category a very separate entity in that sense but faze clan i feel like it's uh opponent driven at times and rv let's not forget kept them very honest - the previous head-to-head on this map and faze have chosen to re-pick it let's see if they can justify it with a good t-haul they even lost to eg on this map phase i do believe so odd yeah it did seem odd oh and i can see reigns crosstalk is absolutely minuscule by the way that is ridiculous and for an old man as well with his eyes he's got a tiny little green dot and they're really trying to explode apartments they are set up and ready to go towards a again this is a rinse and repeater the same strategy it is it looks identical but i wonder if the result will match this time electronic actively contests twists first look and bit realizes upon the first frag of his teammate this pressure coming his way i love that util set bit nerdy but will slow them down reigns found a solution oh has he though he has to walk through greyscreened an electronics set up by the bit util and that will leave them one thing i mean they got nothing left absolutely nothing to celebrate there from faze clan and weapon upgrades galore for those a tested dcts immediately adjusted right that's great in the last round rain was able to get that opening kill onto electronic this time they played a little bit more passive you're talking about that util it's able to set them up it slows phase down and it keeps navi now one round ahead so back into the doldrums of those upgraded pistols this phase last time brokey got two on the way out the door let's see if they're able to get anything else done here now remember if you've just joined us maybe you missed the death segment maybe you haven't been on the social medias right now the winner of this match up will come first in group c they'll skip the round to  they'll go straight through the quarterfinals navier already qualified regardless of the outcome of this match whereas faze look we won't get into the other bits and bobs dude it's so brutal for faze i mean they've been handed what sounds like a really appealing control of their own destiny initially you go hey phase if you win your last game you're through to the playoffs first group first in your group and your sounds like oh well we've had a great few days haven't we until someone says yeah but if you lose you might not even make it it's really brutal oh it's good though that uh everything every single game has something on the line tonight that's one thing that i'm happy about exactly but who's the team they have to beat chad it's only na'vi only the recent champions of our return to lan indeed they really want to exploit a but i don't know what you're trying to explore you mean that simple bit an electronic crossfire no i'm not so sold if i had to pick my if i had to pick my poison chad i think boomerang perfecto sounds a little bit more it does that's that's strange how deadly that a sight setup is yeah well i was thinking that when i saw bit in in pit i was like but that would mean electronics somewhere else and then i realized that there's just this little beautiful equilibrium where they both just get to be annoying around the apps whenever they want yeah so the thing is and you have simple as as the man who's going to be flexing arch side so you're hoping to take advantage of him and the rotations so that's something that i suppose you can exploit if booming perfect are not doing their job because at that point simple will start leaning b a little bit more right but you need to crack that b bomb site first i think we'll see a different approach here from phase this time let's do the a presents and yeah simple wants something he's looking real horny for a frag here towards boiler good util set yeah molly's going to hold him at bay but it's an it's an equal exchange right there right the ct's dump some molly's the t's do as well and this is all just slowing down the pressure they can apply whenever you say equal exchange i just immediately start thinking about alchemy ah yes full metal alchemist i still didn't finish that really no excuse you have no excuse that took me like an extra six months it's a really short i don't know isn't it yeah i think i've marathoned it and there is a start b site as we discussed is exploited boom it's down and the rotation from simple good smoke the utility dump from perfecto certainly is a delayed boosting the all pup i'm not so sure yeah that makes more sense i gotta creep through this here setting them up for success and perfecto just catches carrick and straight through i think the visibility kind of caught carrick in there that's the number advantage they've just given away right i think they were going to explode on towards b so whatever was spotted by perfecto is actually huge because it's allowed simple to now establish himself here towards coffins might be a change attack with  seconds left that's a bit uncomfortable you can see the the discomfort in reigns positioning he's still flirting around with both options i lost the only one with the smoke alex and he's in second mid right now he's on his way they only really have a flash to entry into this olaf will get there he can drop the smoke it's actually baited perfecto away simple they're coming yeah he's actually been caught out whether by design or otherwise they've been given a gift of an open b bombsite chad i can't decide whether it's genius or just a straight coincidence the delay of olof not having a smoke caught simple out that is wild like the round look good for phase after the opener then carrick dies it looks really bad and then simple for whatever reason ants in his pants it's  seconds left he sees perfecto like his muscle memory he just starts you know kind of reacting on the road he's he's planning his route through banana okay well dance around his ankles and that's simple rare to see yeah called off caught off in a big way so phase they keep this margin very close this has just been a back and forth affair some close rounds decisions down to the finest the details here five to four feels like we're having a tennis match that's never going to end right so juice i do love the juice rules though advantage navi i think that's how our overtime goes i didn't want to say it the occlusion of the smoke why does that still happen man i like it felt like he just got completely bs and then you realize he did he did he did well you know not in indefensible i suppose well i could try you could i tried doing enough of that today i don't i don't think i'm going to join that you can't play if you keep finding yourself playing devil's advocate there's a second part to that saying i don't remember bit bit of a wobbly one spray was just a narrow margin off and it's enabled twist to find his head temple's just still picking here they're really aggressive navi yeah i think they just got really really pissed when big kept jumping out they want to do it themselves oh they might just run down this b bomb site here yeah perfecto has got a lot to do and i love the reaction out of him he's managed to make that relatively threatening drops the smoke in time it's pulled simple back over to the site but i think fazer playing a solid game here like they can once again exploit this rotation they've got simple over to b olaf will go poking and prodding it looks like the bomb is going to go back over to the right bonsai electronic is isolated here oh this is twice they've been able to get twist this aggressive on b right now and they just get to play with this a bomb bombsite so unless they face some resistance which uh it looks like pushing that's resistance right there big frag oh yeah and already perfectos caught the bee lurk as well so stars are starting to align for navi but advantage phase in terms of ground bomb now planted kerrigan opts for the site you can see they're discussing their crossfire now olof's actually been let off the leash he's been sent to try and find the first prong of this arm like poor guy booked with his back turn crab walking around the apps and kerrigan stays a number he's being flanked and flashed lovely conversion from rv and they keep a cool head that's huge from electronic right that play is the only way they can get back into that round if he pushes through that smoke he dies it's a safe call the fact he goes through gets a kill he has to take the risky maneuver right that's so risky he's not positioned over towards sight he's not positioned over here he has to go for a gamble push and it pays off and not only that he finds olaf as well so that is a genius maneuver from electronic there and this is it right he's just gone well if you want to win the round i i have to do this right and in certain situations that's all you can get away with and i just realized as well he was the one that you just said killed olaf he went back around all the way into that entrance of abs okay good maneuver there and well badass yeah right now it's going to be a mac  in the hands of twists but everybody else with the aks so your highest fragger with the smg we'll see if they can justify it with a round win i feel like if they get that banana control again they may as well just execute into b right because they they are getting the space if you're able to park twists up that aggressively you can apply pressure towards this b bomb site no dramas whatsoever a safe car molly there hold any maneuvers at bay double nades for the orp molly for the sandbags all looking good but the flash forward yeah boom which wants to look and they're tucked in halfway safe and sound smoked off now simple will stick around and they want to actually isolate onto a instead it's the right call in terms of numbers oh they just called top banana clear again here so yeah they will need to rotate away quickly because they found nothing on their info plays faze could be coming any second now yeah you can see they got the read the rotations are on their way descending for photo the only man with a smoke to go back to the kerrigan's opened up proceedings onto the orpah no less simple's gone and bit doesn't last long either that crossfire has been broken faze into a pretty stacked damn sight and carrigan hunts down electronic as well they knew he'd be lingering on the side that's enough to force the save faze closed the gap once again yeah that was one of those situations where we're talking about keeping simple busy he was over towards that be bombsite for a very very long time i think they were thinking the impending b strike was in just like i was saying right the fact they've gotten that much space it is a cause for concern for navi and that is most likely what kept the third man lingering and then from there the timing simple gets there he's in library but carrigan had already slipped the net so some really good stuff from kerrigan so far finding himself on eight kills tied up with twist at the top of the scoreboard for the faze camp two saved guns money is fine for another navy buy but if it continues back and forth like this you're gonna be happy with the first half of your face right you're going to walk away with you know six or seven rounds so that's a pretty tidy first half we're going to do a little bit of a uh check-in with the fnatic eg game for all the old fanatic well they need to win yes that's clear that's quite clear there is some results that do have to go their way now we'll wait till the first maps are done and then we'll start dialing in on all of that because the desks are going to cover it there's no point us covering it after the first map no but to fill you in for the fnatic one while it was on your screens they actually and it's relevant to us they have to hope that faze loses so they're supporting rv today okay so fanatic fans if you want the black and orange in your playoffs as a debut in their official capacity it would be quite poetic and so is that flashback good god simple was blind for an eternity and there's watercolor electronics gone too olaf has won the round with his ak- alone the only way this falls apart for faze is if navi gamble stacks somewhere right right now as kerrigan is the caller you're just calling pause wait let's see if there's an aggressive maneuver if there's not let's group up let's execute with our superior utility and let's just trade efficiently onto the bomb site giving away a straight kill not the way you want to be doing it position noted now for bit so they still have a one-man advantage here but that is gonna be harder for faze to break and it looks like they want to take some liberties here just dumping nades walking casually not clearing all the corners they know perfecto likely isolated and he is just hanging out behind the pillar oh no no of your chipping away at them kerrigan's gone down as well and now with twists alone on b they're flirting with two bomb sites oh this is on reign how much space is he gonna get before he's able to establish the site he's being brave no contact oh an adjustment out of reign and bit this time handed the headshot as opposed to the other way around that will be the round saved by faze most important kills around i got flashbacks chad you know when you were talking about look all we have to do now we have an advantage i got flashbacks to match making with you i i became you in my soloqueue matchmaking adventures yeah i said exactly what you said i was like talking them through it i was like boys we just got two picks i want you to stand still we're going to group up trade off of each other evenly we'll execute into a site it's safe yeah and you join the first thing he says he goes green you're a coach or something green you coach teams maybe but yeah it was the chad virtual strategy it works sometimes it works it's flawless it's almost like it's it's the fundamentals of counter-strike what what happened right there was them taking it to a bit more of a uh i'm trying to think of a team who we could maybe use for that i think like a heroic would be a good example right you send feelers out right because you you want to see what the resistance is like now the biggest problem when you go for movement is if you just get multi killed you're wrecked if you just get multi-killed like this at the start of the round you're also pretty wrecked so olaf with two huge kills but i'm liking the pace at which they're taking apartments now i've seen simple genuinely look like a human being this entire half like kerrigan shooting him in the side of the head he's rotating when he shouldn't he's been exploited and out shot at times that's face clan doing a whole lot of what they couldn't in their previous head to head and face oh i've opened up again speaking of it it's brokey this time to put his orb in the feed what a gift right simple's about to go for a second mid peak he just takes his eyes away for a second broke he steps out dry that's gonna be adding some level of frustration now and well they can just set up and hit this a bomb site you know it's electronic a bit over here it's likely the ct stay with the - defense this is compulsory man i mean i'll keep getting excited about it if it continues to be this close but i definitely came in with an air of doubt surrounding what phase we're going to be laying down today very happy to see we've got a competitive first half and this is a navi that are looking definitely a little flustered i mean look at this once again a wide open site how often have we been saying that oh even with that kill unless they get gifted another i feel like it has to be the safe yeah the money's just not there for navi to risk this round so they have been whistled down here and this will be the third consecutive round for phase bits still lingering around he's like electronic they said save why are you still in trash but he understands the electronic is the two i see of this ship yeah second in command actually when i think about it maybe he's not the second in command would you say is i reckon simple as a second in command boom which is the first in command okay but booming reports to blade yeah the hierarchy is probably a bit kooky over there yeah as long as everybody wants to win yeah i think that's all simple cares about yeah simple's also got like a jurisdiction on the catering like yeah they have to use his sushi company yeah that's yeah yeah and they they have to use zeus's pizza company zeus's pizza company they're just they're gonna build for every day of the week over there yeah you could truly support each individual member over the course of your taking running is he cooking anything you got anything on the go senior yeah i want to always cook it up i have a stir fry joint or something okay now v you need something here it's starting to get real awkward and it could be another save if they just lose the sight they need guns for the final round of play and their loft bonus is only at   here ouch  damage that's that's a very well spent  bucks can you do that like a dart announcer next time  . imagine if i could actually crunch the numbers that quickly though give you specific readouts just computing live i mean i am called machine unfortunately i'm probably the least mechanical human being around i've seen you with a wrench that's true this right here being stalled out with a low hp it feels like faze might have to do something a bit more direct so waiting up more of the early youtube and i say early we have a minute remaining on the clock here all five members for both teams still stand yeah and i mean fair play to olofmeister and reign they've they've been taking apartments in slow motion they have the patience and now they're going to be poking b now this is interesting let's see navi's reaction here carragher's trying to be smart but unfortunately reigns taking contact way too soon they haven't shown the bomb but they'll clear him oh kerrigan carrigan you are a loud boy as he stamped through the apartments electronic about hello is that the explosive device that you intended to plant oh if brokie can do some damage here never mind he goes down to bit then that would have been all right but - tied back up let's see who takes the lead here in the final round of play the fact that as soon as kerrigan is a like they're calling that three holes pop off the bee fake as soon as boomers gets the first kill from graveyard you know you've made the wrong call because it's a it's more of an a stack right they had four players over here electronic gets this one as carrigan is trying to transit over towards what should have been the less defended bomb site but still this is a great t ha from phase right now they're gonna be happy with this yeah notice navi you really haven't quite been won over by the uh org conversation maybe i should bite my tongue until we get to newt but maybe we'll see a differentiate difference between the two but yeah they're not quite in the same boat as a lot of other teams in this group starting to show almost two orgs of full buy for some numbers really liking this apartments play aren't they they do but i mean it hasn't really been exploited in response from an rv the boost is gonna really really ruin reigns date i wonder where the line in the sandy's leader has drawn for him likely is about there it seems to me that right now with carrigan with this smoke play top banana they're going to want to draw some movement on a and see if they can pounce rain nola for dropping back now top banana control is confirmed yeah well that's some of the similar util they've done previously on the a commits so that's going to only encourage navi to dig their heels in deeper it really hinges on what kerrigan finds but this is the pressure from here go he's flash for bit saves the day he finds both of them and perfecto oh he's babysat nicely boomish saves him gets the info knows they're committing spotted out twists and brokey and the bomb on the backpack of twists they're in a lot of trouble last round so full commit five versus two becomes a one versus five and brokey last alive there he goes na'vi went out the half phase posting these total rounds they posted in the previous head to head looking better one inferno and an eight seven half will be swapped inside faze to defend their honor navi to attack  there's one guy that'll lock this whole thing down so this is definitely doable for electronic no armor though they've got the kits they can't do this  device wasn't ready he could knock his tag off the bar the double  here comes electronic into the bomb site taking two heads and coming in big it's crunch time every single game that's happening simultaneously three streams running for the last day of play for group c and it's all up in the air as his tradition at least one of these groups has to be completely undetermined cutting into the final day i've got chad burchell with me who understands everything far more than i do at least in this department of group c results i wouldn't say everything i reckon i've got you beaten on ballet yeah yes yes yeah you took some i just watched it yeah to be fair it's up for debate your mom probably educated you uh very well subconsciously uh perfecto hasn't bought anything chad don't you start your little theory crafting put it away okay go back to your little theory craft after we see how this one should be i'm excited by this it's do you think simple is getting an ak and all the trimmings as long as they plant look how much money perfector will have next round if navi plant and lose this round okay just just bear with me all right he's set the seed he's planted it i'll let you guys choose whether or not you want to water it this has the dream again here so the p the two smoke set up right now when the collision caught in terrain owie ouch just blocked to the dome and now well panic stations were broken kerrigan they've got five blocks who want their name and number ah the first bullet on the adjustment straight to the dome of carrick and does conclude the round and now it could be dream world for navy not only winning the round getting the bomb down saving some extra cash on perfecto and their contingency plan may not need to be activated now i hate that this is the meta right here and okay i was gonna say i hate that this is the meta right now where the cts are better off just saving their armor so they can get the cheap upgrade into a head armor in the next round olaf didn't want to do that and that's fair enough oh it's an old-school guy back in this day yeah back in his day would have gone for that he probably would have won it too but twists here he's gonna go for the cheap kevlar upgrade now they are gonna win the round so the ramifications of perfecto not buying anything on pistol is not going to be as juicy but uh we'll save it we'll save it if there is a team out there a professional counter-strike that on the t side of a map would like to full eco get into an area or bomb site of the map plants what's the best map for this strategy to actually actively i i'm calling mirage i'm calling maybe yeah could do like a b site mirage maybe you could go for something on like ancient with just like a straight up like be wrapped you don't need to win the round no you don't need to win you just do the machine tv mirage strap four of you go b with util and the other guy kind of you all need to be oh you're right everyone has to be eco not even a decoy no so like on train like in a bomb site would have been a good use of it uh yes it would right like nuke if you could just do a ramp rush and go straight lower yeah right so there's a couple but if you go if you do that see how much money you have in the second round you'll have galils and util give it give it a crack we'll do a little experiment tonight if you want oh bloody hell man it's gonna be late it's already past my bedtime sorted the problem out as rain wanted info instead he finds an smg to the face poor old carrigan flash for info no one's blind and booming is gonna catch a scalpel lucky there didn't he lovely follow up from broke he could convert the no scope i'm afraid that might be all to celebrate for phase in this one yeah so this is going to be navi now extending their lead  rounds for them to the good that's a three round differential to phases seven i'm gonna have a second crack here now if faze can pull off what navi did in that first half which was lose the force by but win the follow-up with the saved weaponry then i'll be very impressed there's no reason they can't especially with twisty boy olaf and brokie holding on to their goodies i will say i think faze's ct sides have been uh where they've accrued more of their stable rounds in this group taking a look at their t sites they've had some woeful t-round t halves don't remember the i mean well don't forget but also try not to remember the overpass game against finale right forget about that one okay that's into my mind for sure as was the mirage i mean don't forget that that was a quick one as well yeah no wind beneath their wings in that one i think they they weren't believers in that game all right well let's see how can brokey brokey for me is probably the catalyst of this round for faze to win right because if he could do something a little bit funky if he can get that scout working and get a tag or two yeah then i think we're off to a good start for these pistols to be able to chip away two usps one for kerrigan one oh reigns upgraded into a p what a special treat yeah so this one could get spicy but like it says after broke he's about to get run boosted special delivery simple accepts that package yeah that's a dream that is exactly what you were prophesizing chad he took two chunks out of boom he's been hard done by there olaf so much damage just shy of finishing the jar bit will swallow the nade thrown by now the cold dead hands of twists i'm afraid faith kind of relying on carrick and staying alive now they'll just take some space stay alive is it the bg's i don't know oh anyone that's slightly older than me is going to hate me for even asking that question staying alive we need o.j on like speed he's radio job it's the bg's well done alex we got confirmation yep okay nice nice nice well you can tell by the way i use my walk i'm a woman's man no time to talk okay music loud and women warm i've been kicked around since i was born all right thank you very much that's the bee gees it's spoken word in spoken word okay interpretive poem by machine tv well uh you didn't uh rhyme no you don't need to in slam poetry you don't no what about uh what's is it a haiku haiku that's the one that follows a very specific formula it's like blah blah blah you know certain amount of lines i think in a haiku or is it a words it's to do with the amount of syllables i thought the syllables okay that does sound believable oh i just typed in haikyuu like the volleyball did you watch any of that no i haven't yet chad but it's still a hard recommend from you i haven't i haven't kept up to date but it's pretty hype also i want to let everybody at home know i put an anime profile picture on my steam profile and i've won two out of three games i've played with it so good odds yeah i didn't realize that you know previously anime profile pictures were just the dodgy kids in matchmaking now everyone the higher echelons of fbl is a weeb too you gotta do it well simple's got an anime probe yeah oh well that explains it yeah i can show you if you want hold up who's he got where is it well you must know him i think it's is it the green goblin not the green goblin spider-man in the building all right this is an important round here ladies and gentlemen no more silly businesses it seems a bit silly rain has a mac  but he's all the way down banana so lethal range for him bro he's kept that scout so it's weird that this is a bonus round for the cts uh but it is a little bit for brokey and rain so certainly this one's them trying to get the most out of their little investment yeah with an eight seven half phase they've swallowed the pride of conceding the pistol this is where you get to voice your concern the first time unfortunately though if you are phased your opportunities will be numbered with nafi already posting . this is a big one this channel's already outlined it seems like navi were not really desperate to commit to anything they've still got  seconds we know as certainly historically navi not afraid to run down that clock oh does the electronic weight this out he does looks like he smells something's up here oh he's just got a perfect crosshair placement regardless flashing him off range got him here should be and does deliver oh and he tagged another sets up brokey for the conversion navi gonna be propelled into kerrigan's solo behold well if they're quick it's just him yeah and he's got no util at all bro brokey would have to do some magical stuff with a single flashbang carrigan maybe have it above his head there it is and no one flashed maybe he slows them down  seconds broke he's in position now the boom it's clear he's looking the wrong way kerrigan sprayed the wrong way ah he's been run down and navi have the sight twist trying his luck through the smoke as it fades boom tucked it on the new box a flash from olof should set them up for the walk perfecto does lose vision temporarily but it's not cost them anything oh he's made away with that noise murder yeah i mean perfectly taking the contact but boom it's swinging out at the same time part of me loves the visualization i'm just counting it down you know saying three two one and that's huge hit your keyboard that should break faze clan once again they'll come in for the full better bonus buy yeah we'll see them with zero dollars left in the bank account for the majority to be fair right out of the mac  carried through with the scout on brokey they actually got a lot from it right but look it does set them up with another potent buy right now so you can't really critique was it the right idea keeping those weapons in play they got a lot done with them it's just everybody else really letting that one slip that retake situation just there really really messy like it felt like they maybe had a bit more time they could have tried to isolate some fights booming stepping up in a huge way there i can't believe he was able to stay alive and take carrigan out of that round well this is it if navi are able to just force through phase on this one take away as many rifles as humanly possible we've got max lost bonus in play but b stream update mouse sports if they win they're in and they are up three round advantage up against big clan in that first map that's happening on the b stream just cs go underscore b and b might be the letter that's appropriate for na'vi's seaside as well smoked off for now they go knock in rain smokes them off and will propel or repel them whether or not they'll head into the a site remains to be seen it looks like if anything they're actually gathering to go as it fades bits the last part of the puzzle and he's on his way as well rain does have a smoke here is he going to go for something back at the site is he going to go for something deeper here i think he's going to save it that smoke from bit they're just hopefully going to keep broken twists planted we're clearing top mid it's about to get real juicy here they come carrigan reign good flash but that's all they've got that divider smoke will be thrown out rain needs a multi kill here it's compulsory there's so many people looking for him trying to play around the smoke he's tanked up a few safe and that's enough for the face clown boys would rather have another go in round  if you're navi now and you've heard me get on this a couple of times here they should start having a little bit of a chase whether it be with one or two members just start having a look to see if you can deny something here from phase maybe around too early you know but at some point you can start letting the boys off the leash let them have a look let them start sniffing out these opponents next round the max loss bonus you can get olaf and twists who can drop guns or broke he can drop as well everybody will get that   into the back pocket here just means someone is gonna be light on utility commanding though from navi now this is five on the trot on this t half they had a back and forth affair there it's seven in a row from the tail end of the first half so really picking up some momentum and some steam here and moving into the next map because if you missed the veto you can see in the top right it is newt coming up next and well faze removed mirage which i think was a cause for concern for some i mean if if it continues in this trend if we don't see faze voice something in this round here they could have finished eight seven and end up with the bloody same score line i thought we were set for you know double digits bare minimum to push the navi boys but yeah a couple of lost gun rounds the pistol and his conversions his left left face with a couple of options kerrigan what throws caution to the wind straight down banana it's reigns multi-kill that could be the difference as a good tag simple somehow tracks him as the norwegian does tuck in a risky push a big miss from broken navi still relevant hold on olaf now the only man here over towards and he's pushing through apartments gonna take a more aggressive stance as the three navi members will wrap around the site they're going to get a free avenue oh i lost completely given them the site as well yeah and they've called it clear simple reacts with the plant safe in the sight look where bitten electronic are tell me they don't get enough practice to play in these positions they know their angles and they cross fire as well here we go this is going to be such a tough nut to crack i don't envy them all off with only the farmer sure he's got some util he'd love to get that well placed out of the abs apartment position yeah he knows they're in there and softens him up twists just molotov down in response the time there's nothing left olaf would have to pull out some crazy shots oh my god yeah he gave him a quick reminder of who he was doesn't quite find the final headshot of the three but he keeps them honest and that puts narvi on  faze clan looking to respond they have picked the very same map they were beaten up by navionic alone oh okay imagine if you had an m instead of the player i know harvest the sea will see these nasty you can see him aggressively wiggling his mouse after is this thing broken yeah where was the kill all right well back up against the wall against the ropes whatever cliche you want to go with right now faze clan are under the pump broke he's been able to get the big green back out thanks to olof i mean i think after those kills it's enabled him to get drop an orb and get a fam ass in his hands solid hall now they are just walking straight in uncontested right now alex nobody on face has double digit kills right now yeah that is odd and boom it is so good at being ahead of the pack never mind finding impact from it he's so far ahead of them it's over look it's simple he's pushed up the tree already they're just bloodlusting for these frags and if they find them it's not gonna be pretty max lost sure but broke you was going to want to hold on to his awp i suspect you can't just feel i mean up against a full navi squad still the bomb ticking yeah and they're pushing as well here pep in their steps simple trying to clear out his corners the orp oversight has looked away twist is on an island he gets destroyed broke he's been spotted electronic is on the chase oh leave me alone bro oh come on now electronic is gonna get oh i thought he was gonna get all off there but he just walked past in time boomage unless you turn towards boiler how good are the comms not good enough apparently oh they look for pip you might try and get an ak oh hold on they're all there they're all there just keep what you got you need something okay all right uh well it was a competitive first half we're sorry if you only tuned in for the second half yeah uh it's kind of changed the dialogue of this game completely but what a heroic effort here from boomi he trusted so heavily in his teammates utility to set him up that he's running in looking at the ground into the b bomb site and that smiles yeah why the hell not i've been watching this just yesterday when we were casting navi as well like you see how far ahead of the entire execute he plays i don't know if it's exactly from a sacrificial point but he does get so much good work done if i knew that every in-game leader was just going to become an entry fragger maybe i would have kept playing it's just mental like these are the this is in-game leaders for the longest time or indeed different formulations of teams were like the guy who had to stay alive in the mid round yeah right you were setting other people up these guys are getting set up oh boomish flash through the carrick has done very well there gets the first somehow gets away good luck have fun for covering that ak he has warning shots on the way out the tour as well very close to low hp yeah but that doesn't mean that rain now is going to be an established turret on banana if they want to get take back that b site you've got a very angry norwegian ready and waiting for you he wants a round just one ct round let's just do better than last time for the bare minimum you picked this for a reason would feel hard done by to have it end exactly the same way two - losses in their series in cologne after an - half it looks so promising down goes rain that was supposed to be there ray of hope now he's twist has an mp now it's just a desperate prayer don't have to use their four to shoot now okay i'll stop with the priest references it's three to three bombs going down an odd little plant corner for simple but it doesn't mean you'll be safe from the spray brokey perhaps can find finish off bit for hp bit of a heartbreaker and poor old olof's got no hope really carrick is the one with the kit he's low hp now loose on the side navi condemn phase with the same score  to seven inferno phases pick and nothing to show
